b.　When man sinned, he rebelled against God, denied God's authority, and rejected God's rule; at Babel men rebelled collectively against God to abolish God's authority from the earth—Gen. 3:1-6; 11:1-9.

1.　Satan has a kingdom, the authority of darkness, which is against the kingdom of God—Matt. 12:26; Acts 26:18:

2.　Between the word concerning the kingdom of God in Mark 4:26-29 and the record of the demonstration of the kingdom of God in 5:1-20, there is the incident of the stormy sea in 4:35-41:

<p class="CC4">b　主斥责风，又命令海安静，因为在幕后的乃是背叛的天使和鬼。</p>
b.　The Lord rebuked the wind and commanded the sea to be silent because of the rebellious angels and demons who were behind the scene.

A.　What is described in Mark 9:1-13 is a picture of the kingdom of God coming in power; the center of this picture is the glorified Jesus, and with Him are Moses and Elijah, representing the Old Testament saints, and Peter, James, and John, representing the New Testament saints—vv. 2-4.
<p class="CC2">二　主耶稣变化形像，意思就是祂的人性被祂的神性所浸透、饱和；这个变化形像，就是祂的得荣耀，等于祂在祂国里的来临─2节：</p>
B.　For the Lord Jesus to be transfigured meant that His humanity was saturated and permeated with His divinity; this transfiguration, which was His glorification, was equal to His coming in His kingdom—v. 2:
<p class="CC3">1　主在一节里关于神的国带着能力来临的话，借着祂在山上的变化形像得着应验─2～3节。</p>
