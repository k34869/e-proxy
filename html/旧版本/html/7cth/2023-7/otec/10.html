<p class="AA2">总题：经营美地所预表包罗万有的基督，为着建造召会作基督的身体，为着国度的实际与实现，并为着新妇得以为主的来临将自己预备</p>
<p class="AA1">第十篇　我们要据有基督作美地所必须看见并经历的管制原则</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">Governing Principles That We Need to See and Experience in Order to Possess Christ as the Good Land</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：西二6~7，林前六17，十二12~13，徒九3~5，出十三21~22，西四2</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　“你们既然接受了基督，就是主耶稣，……就要在祂里面行事为人”─西二6~7：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">I.　"As therefore you have received the Christ, Jesus the Lord, walk in Him"—Col. 2:6:</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　我们既然接受了基督，就该在祂里面行事为人；在祂里面行事为人就是在祂里面生活、行动、举止、为人，使我们能享受祂的丰富，就如以色列人住在美地，享受其上一切丰富的出产。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　As we have received Christ, we should walk in Him; to walk in Him is to live, to act, to behave, and to have our being in Christ so that we may enjoy His riches, just as the children of Israel lived in the good land, enjoying all its rich produce.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　今天的美地就是基督作为包罗万有的灵（加三14），祂住在我们的灵里（提后四22，罗八16），作我们的享受。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　The good land today is Christ as the all-inclusive Spirit (Gal. 3:14), who dwells in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16) to be our enjoyment.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">三　照着灵并凭着灵而行（4，加五16），乃是新约的中心和关键。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">C.　To walk according to the spirit and by the Spirit (v. 4; Gal. 5:16) is the central and crucial point in the New Testament.</p></p>
<p class="CC1">贰　我们要在基督里行事为人，就是照着并凭着作美地之实际的灵而行，就必须看见那蒙重生有三部分之信徒与终极完成之三一神属灵交通的关键，乃是林前六章十七节─“与主联合的，便是与主成为一灵”：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">II.　To walk in Christ, that is, to walk according to the spirit and by the Spirit as the reality of the good land, we must see that the key of the spiritual fellowship of the regenerated tripartite believers with the consummated Triune God is 1 Corinthians 6:17—"He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit":</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　我们用我们的灵敬拜是灵的神─约四24。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　We worship God the Spirit with our spirit—John 4:24.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　我们从那是灵的神而生，就是灵─三6。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　We were regenerated of God as the Spirit to be a spirit—3:6.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">三　那灵同我们的灵见证我们是神的儿女─罗八16。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">C.　The Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God—Rom. 8:16.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">四　我们成为神在我们灵里的居所，而那灵是内住者─弗二22。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">D.　We become a dwelling place of God in our spirit, and the Spirit is the Indweller—Eph. 2:22.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">五　主耶稣作为那是灵的基督并作为赐生命的灵，是在我们的灵里─提后四22，罗八10。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">E.　The Lord Jesus as the pneumatic Christ and as the life-giving Spirit is in our spirit—2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:10.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">六　那叫耶稣从死人中复活者的灵，若住在我们里面，那叫基督从死人中复活的，也必借着祂住在我们里面的灵，赐生命给我们必死的身体─11节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">F.　If the Spirit of the One who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in us, He who raised Christ from the dead will also give life to our mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells us—v. 11.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">七　我们若靠着那灵治死身体的行为，必要活着─13节下。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">G.　If by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body, we will live—v. 13b.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">八　我们将心思置于灵，好得着生命平安─6节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">H.　We set our mind on the spirit for life and peace—v. 6.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">九　那属基督耶稣的人，是已经（靠着那灵）把肉体连肉体的邪情私欲，都钉了十字架─加五24。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">I.　They who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts (by the Spirit)—Gal. 5:24.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十　当我们凭着灵而行，就绝不会满足肉体的情欲─16节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">J.　When we walk by the Spirit, we will by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh—v. 16.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十一　我们若凭着灵活着，也就当凭着灵而行─25节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">K.　If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit—v. 25.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十二　我们在灵里并照着灵（调和的灵）而行（为人），好成就律法义的要求─罗八4。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">L.　We walk (have our being) in and according to the spirit (the mingled spirit) for the fulfilling of the righteousness of the law—Rom. 8:4.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十三　我们凭着耶稣基督之灵全备的供应，活基督并显大祂─腓一19下~21上。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">M.　By the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we live Christ and magnify Him— Phil. 1:19b-21a.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十四　我们时时在灵里祷告─弗六18。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">N.　We pray at every time in spirit—Eph. 6:18.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十五　我们在那灵里得以圣别─罗十五16。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">O.　We are sanctified in the Spirit—Rom. 15:16.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十六　我们在我们的灵里被那灵更新─多三5，弗四23。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">P.　We are renewed by the Spirit in our spirit—Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十七　我们由主灵变化成为基督荣耀的形像─林后三18。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">Q.　We are transformed by the Lord Spirit into the glorious image of Christ—2 Cor. 3:18.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">十八　终极完成之三一神作为那灵与变化之三部分的人作为新妇，至终成为属灵的配偶，神性与人性的调和（启二二17上），而成为终极完成的新耶路撒冷，作祂永远的扩大和彰显，使神圣的荣耀显于得荣的人性（二一10~11）。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">R.　The Spirit as the consummated Triune God and the bride as the transformed tripartite man eventually become a spiritual couple, a mingling of divinity with humanity (Rev. 22:17a), to be the consummated New Jerusalem for His eternal enlargement and expression with the divine glory manifested in the glorified humanity (21:10-11).</p></p>
<p class="CC1">叁　我们必须看见我们需要在其中行事为人的那一位，乃是在其三个时期丰满职事里的基督：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">III.　We need to see that the One in whom we need to walk is the Christ in His full ministry of three stages:</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　神的中心启示乃是圣经中关于神的渐进启示─“单身”的神、成肉体的神、救赎的神、复合的神、加强的神、内住的神与合并的神；合并的神就是身体基督，终极完成于“已婚”的神，就是终极合并的神，新耶路撒冷。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　The central revelation of God is the progressive revelation of God in the Bible—the "bachelor" God, the incarnated God, the redeeming God, the compounded God, the intensified God, the indwelling God, and the incorporated God; the incorporated God is the Body-Christ that ultimately consummates in the "married" God, the ultimately incorporated God, the New Jerusalem.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　主的恢复乃是恢复那在祂三个时期─成肉体、总括与加强─丰满职事里的基督；主的恢复乃是神成了肉体，肉体成了赐生命的灵，赐生命的灵成了七倍加强的灵，为要建造召会，成为基督的身体，终极完成新耶路撒冷：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　The Lord's recovery is the recovery of Christ in His full ministry of three stages—incarnation, inclusion, and intensification; the Lord's recovery is God becoming the flesh, the flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit to build up the church that becomes the Body of Christ and that consummates the New Jerusalem:</p></p>
<p class="CC3">1　“神成了肉体”，乃是“单身”的神成了成肉体的神和救赎的神─约一1、14、29。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">1.　God becoming the flesh is the "bachelor" God becoming the incarnated God and the redeeming God—John 1:1, 14, 29.</p></p>
<p class="CC3">2　“肉体成了赐生命的灵，赐生命的灵成了七倍加强的灵”，乃是复合的神成了加强的神，作为内住的神─林前十五45下，启一4，三1，四5，五6。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">2.　The flesh becoming the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit becoming the sevenfold intensified Spirit is the compounded God becoming the intensified God to be the indwelling God—1 Cor. 15:45b; Rev. 1:4; 3:1; 4:5; 5:6.</p></p>
<p class="CC3">3　“建造的召会，成为基督的身体，终极完成新耶路撒冷”，乃是合并的神，就是身体基督，要终极完成新耶路撒冷，就是经过过程并终极完成之三一神，与三部分的人所构成经过过程并终极完成之召会，终极的联结、调和与合并─约十七21，弗四4~6、16，西二19，启十九7~9，二一2、9~10。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">3.　The built-up church that becomes the Body of Christ and that consummates the New Jerusalem is the incorporated God, the Body-Christ, that consummates the New Jerusalem, the ultimate union, mingling, and incorporation of the processed and consummated Triune God with the processed and consummated tripartite church—John 17:21; Eph. 4:4-6, 16; Col. 2:19; Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9-10.</p></p>
<p class="CC1">肆　主当前的恢复乃是要在召会生活中恢复身体基督（“那基督”）；身体基督就是合并的神；因此，在基督里行事为人就是在祂这身体基督里，也就是在合并的神里行事为人─林前十二12~13，徒九4~5、15，西二19，弗四1~6、15~16，约十四23，十七21：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">IV.　The Lord's present recovery is the recovery of the Body-Christ ("the Christ") in the church life; the Body-Christ is the incorporated God; thus, to walk in Christ is to walk in Him as the Body-Christ, who is the incorporated God—1 Cor. 12:12-13; Acts 9:4-5, 15; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:1-6, 15-16; John 14:23; 17:21:</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　林前十二章十二节说，“就如身体是一个，却有许多肢体，而且身体上一切的肢体虽多，仍是一个身体，那基督（直译）也是这样；”在这节里，“那基督”不是个人的基督，乃是团体的基督，就是基督与祂所有肢体的合并。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　First Corinthians 12:12 says, "Even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ"; "the Christ" in this verse is not the individual Christ but the corporate Christ, Christ incorporated with all His members.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　这就是保罗在他被征服而悔改归向基督时所看见团体的“我”；他看见主耶稣和祂的信徒是一个伟大的人─那奇妙的“我”─徒九3~5。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　This is the corporate "Me" that the apostle Paul saw in his vanquishing conversion to Christ; he saw that the Lord Jesus and His believers are one great person—the wonderful "Me"—Acts 9:3-5.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">三　我们必须看见，今天我们需要在祂里面行事为人的基督，不仅是个人的基督，也是奇妙的“我”，身体基督，就是合并的神。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">C.　We need to see that the Christ in whom we need to walk today is not only the individual Christ but also the wonderful "Me," the Body-Christ, who is the incorporated God.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">四　接受基督并在祂里面行事为人，就是接受身体基督并在身体基督里行事为人，因为今天基督乃是团体的身体；基督不再只是个人的基督，也是团体的基督，就是头连同身体；在团体的基督里行事为人，会使我们的基督徒生活大大不同。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">D.　To receive and to walk in Christ is to receive and to walk in the Body-Christ, because Christ today is a corporate Body; Christ is no longer only the individual Christ but also the corporate Christ, the Head with the Body; it makes a great difference in our Christian life for us to walk in the corporate Christ.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">五　主的恢复是恢复“基督化”，就是纯粹并全然恢复基督的人位，好在召会生活中得着身体基督的实际─帖前五23，腓一19~21上，三8~14，林后二10，西三10~11。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">E.　The Lord's recovery is the recovery of "Christification," a recovery purely and wholly of the person of Christ to gain the reality of the Body-Christ in the church life—1 Thes. 5:23; Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:8-14; 2 Cor. 2:10; Col. 3:10-11.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">六　今天主正在召会生活中建造身体基督；在身体基督里，有基督作到祂所有的肢体里面，祂所有的肢体也借着生命的长大和生命的变化，被作到祂里面，使基督得着彰显─二19，罗十二2，林后三18，林前十二12~13：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">F.　Today the Lord is building the Body-Christ in the church life; in the Body-Christ, Christ is wrought into all His members, and all His members are wrought into Him by the growth in life and transformation in life for the expression of Christ—2:19; Rom. 12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 Cor. 12:12-13:</p></p>
<p class="CC3">1　在身体基督里，我们享受基督作一切─3节下、13节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">1.　In the Body-Christ we enjoy Christ as everything—vv. 3b, 13.</p></p>
<p class="CC3">2　在身体基督里，所有的肢体都尽功用─14~22节。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">2.　In the Body-Christ there is the function of all the members—vv. 14-22.</p></p>
<p class="CC3">3　在身体基督里，众肢体在三一神的一里调和在一起─23~27节，约十七21，弗四1~6。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">3.　In the Body-Christ there is the blending together of the members in the oneness of the Triune God—vv. 23-27; John 17:21; Eph. 4:1-6.</p></p>
<p class="CC1">伍　我们要据有包罗万有的基督作美地的实际，并在祂里面行事为人，就需要看见我们在主里的生活并在主里的工作上，主的同在对我们乃是一切；在出埃及三十三章十二至十七节，摩西与神讨价还价，要求神的同在与他和神的百姓同去；神回应说，“我的同在必和你同去，我必使你得安息”─14节：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">V.　In order to possess and walk in the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land, we need to see that the presence of the Lord means everything to us in both our life in the Lord and our work in the Lord; in Exodus 33:12-17 Moses bargained with God for His presence to go with him and with God's people; God responded by saying, "My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest"—v. 14:</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　主活在我们里面，我们无论去哪里，祂都会去，但祂的同在和我们同去么？许多时候主也许帮助我们，但我们并不叫祂喜乐；我们必须受主头手直接的同在所管制。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　The Lord lives in us, and He will go wherever we go, but is His presence going with us? Many times the Lord may help us, but He may not be happy with us; we need to be governed by the direct, firsthand presence of the Lord.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　主的同在，主的微笑，乃是我们进入并据有基督作美地之实际的管制原则；神的同在就是道路，是“地图”，将祂的百姓当行的路指示他们。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　The presence, the smile of the Lord, is the governing principle for us to enter into and possess Christ as the reality of the good land; God's presence is the way, the "map," that shows His people the way they should take.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">三　按照出埃及记的图画，主的同在在他们前面行，“日间在云柱中领他们的路；夜间在火柱中光照他们，使他们日夜都可以行走。日间云柱，夜间火柱，总不离开百姓的面前”─十三21~22：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">C.　According to the picture in Exodus, the presence of the Lord went before them "by day in a pillar of cloud to lead them on the way and by night in a pillar of fire to give them light, that they might go by day and by night. Neither the pillar of cloud by day nor the pillar of fire by night departed from before the people"—13:21-22:</p></p>
<p class="CC3">1　按预表，云表征那灵（林前十1~2）；照亮的火表征神的话（诗一一九105，耶二三29）；因此，神的同在所给即时、活的带领，乃是借着灵或话临到的。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">1.　In typology the cloud signifies the Spirit (1 Cor. 10:1-2), and the fire, for enlightening, signifies the Word of God (Psa. 119:105; Jer. 23:29); hence, the instant, living leading from the presence of God comes through either the Spirit or the Word.</p></p>
<p class="CC3">2　云柱和火柱象征神自己，因为神是灵也是话（约四24，一1）；不仅如此，话也是灵（六63，弗六17）。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">2.　The two pillars symbolize God Himself, for He is both the Spirit and the Word (John 4:24; 1:1); furthermore, the Word is also the Spirit (6:63; Eph. 6:17).</p></p>
<p class="CC3">3　因此，神、话、灵乃是一，日夜不断地带领并引导我们；在基督徒的生活中，白昼和黑夜并无两样，因为火柱所发的光，使黑夜变为白昼。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">3.　Thus, God, the Word, and the Spirit are one to lead and guide us continually, whether by day or by night; in the Christian life there is no difference between day and night, for the light from the pillar of fire causes the night to become day.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">四　出埃及记也给我们看见，基督作为神的使者乃是带领百姓的那一位；当神的使者行动时，柱子也动，表明使者和柱子乃是一；基督和带领的灵是不能分开的（十四19，约十四17~20，十六13，林后三17，启五6）；再者，每当跟随主的人遭遇反对，引导的光自然就成为保护的光；然而，这保护的光对反对者却成了黑暗（出十四20）。─引用经文</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">D.　Exodus also shows us that Christ as the Angel of God was the One who was leading the people; when the Angel of God moved, the pillar moved also, showing that the Angel and the pillar were one; Christ and the leading Spirit cannot be separated (14:19; John 14:17- 20; 16:13; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rev. 5:6); furthermore, whenever those who follow the Lord face opposition, the guiding light spontaneously becomes the protecting light; however, to the opposers the protecting light becomes darkness (Exo. 14:20).</p></p>
<p class="CC1">陆　我们要据有包罗万有的基督作美地的实际，并在祂里面行事为人，就需要在我们的生活和事奉上有多而彻底的祷告，借此在祭司职分的实际里生活并事奉─彼前二5、9，西四2：</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">VI.　In order to possess and walk in the all-inclusive Christ as the reality of the good land, we need to live and serve in the reality of the priesthood by having much and thorough prayer in our life and service—1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Col. 4:2:</p></p>
<p class="CC2">一　召会是不是活的、新鲜的、丰富的，就在于这件事：我们要一直被那灵充满；我们要一直被那灵充满，就需要是乐意、倒空并祷告的人─2节，腓二13，太五3、8，路一53，弗五18。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">A.　Whether the church is living and fresh and enriched depends on this one thing—that we are being filled continuously with the Spirit; in order to be filled continuously with the Spirit, we need to be those who are willing, empty, and praying—v. 2; Phil. 2:13; Matt. 5:3, 8; Luke 1:53; Eph. 5:18.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">二　建造召会的尊贵工作所需的智慧、悟性、知识和技巧，必须是对我们成了那灵的神自己；唯有神的灵才能借着我们建造祂自己的居所─出三一1~3，亚四6。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">B.　The wisdom, understanding, knowledge, and skill for the noble work of building up the church must be God Himself as the Spirit to us; only the Spirit of God can build His own dwelling place through us—Exo. 31:1-3; Zech. 4:6.</p></p>
<p class="CC2">三　如果各召会里的众圣徒都坚定持续地祷告，主的恢复就会大大地得着丰富并拔高；不仅如此，众圣徒也会享受主，享受主的同在和祂即时并常时的膏油涂抹；他们会终日享受主的笑脸，并且基督活的人位会成为他们的经历和享受。</p>
<p style="color:#808080;">C.　If all the saints in all the churches persevere in prayer, the recovery will be greatly enriched and uplifted; furthermore, the saints will enjoy the Lord, His presence, and His instant and constant anointing; all day long they will enjoy the smile of the Lord's face, and the living person of Christ will become their experience and enjoyment.</p></p>
