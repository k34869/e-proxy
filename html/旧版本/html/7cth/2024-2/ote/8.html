"Fully Accomplish Your Ministry"</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#2040A0;">

<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#999999;">
Scripture Reading: Acts 1:17, 25; 2 Tim. 4:5d; 1 Tim. 1:12; 2 Cor. 4:1; Eph. 4:11-12; Col. 4:17</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
I.　In the eyes of the Lord there is just one ministry—2 Cor. 4:1; Eph. 4:12:</p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
A.　Speaking of the need of a replacement for Judas, Peter said that Judas "was numbered among us and was allotted his portion of this ministry"—Acts 1:17:<br/>
1.　The apostles prayed for the Lord to show them clearly the one whom He had chosen "to take the place of this ministry and apostleship"—vv. 24-25.<br/>
2.　As used in verses 17 and 25, the word ministry refers to the ministry that bears the testimony of Jesus—v. 8:<br/>
a.　Though the apostles were twelve in number, their ministry was uniquely one—this ministry, a corporate ministry in the principle of the Body of Christ.<br/>
b.　All the apostles carried out the same ministry to bear the unique testimony of the incarnated, resurrected, and ascended Jesus Christ, who is the Lord of all.<br/>
B.　In 2 Corinthians 4:1 Paul says, "Having this ministry as we have been shown mercy, we do not lose heart":<br/>
1.　The ministry in 2 Corinthians is the corporate ministry of the New Testament ministers:<br/>
a.　All the ministers have their own portion of the ministry.<br/>
b.　In this corporate ministry Paul had his portion, Peter had his portion, and Timothy had his portion—2 Tim. 4:5d.<br/>
c.　When we add all the portions together, we have "this ministry," which is the New Testament ministry.<br/>
2.　The many ministers have one ministry—the ministry of the new covenant for the accomplishment of God's New Testament economy.<br/>
3.　All the apostles' works are to carry out this unique ministry, the ministering of Christ to people for the building up of His Body.<br/>
C.　Second Corinthians 3:6 tells us that God has made us "sufficient as ministers of a new covenant":<br/>
1.　The Spirit, the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God, imparts the divine life, even God Himself, into the believers and the apostles, making them ministers of a new covenant.<br/>
2.　Hence, their ministry is constituted with the Triune God of life by His life giving Spirit—1 Cor. 15:45b.<br/>
D.　"I give thanks to Him who empowers me, Christ Jesus our Lord, that He has counted me faithful, appointing me to the ministry"—1 Tim. 1:12:<br/>
1.　In this verse Paul does not say, "He appointed me to my ministry."<br/>
2.　Paul says that the Lord appointed him to the one unique, corporate New Testament ministry.<br/>
3.　We all should praise the Lord that by His mercy and grace He has appointed us to the corporate ministry that builds up the Body of Christ—Eph. 4:12, 16.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
II.　Although the foregoing verses reveal that the ministry in the New Testament is corporate, certain other verses indicate that the ministry is also personal:</p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
A.　Acts 20:24 refers to Paul's personal ministry because Paul speaks of the ministry which he had received from the Lord; the ministry in this verse is the personal ministry:<br/>
1.　Paul's ministry was his being; he and Christ had become one—Eph. 3:17a; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:8-9; 4:1.<br/>
2.　What he preached was what he was; he ministered his very being to others.<br/>
3.　Paul was one with Christ and had been constituted of Christ; thus, his ministry was a ministry of the Christ who had been constituted into his being.<br/>
B.　Acts 21:19 definitely and clearly refers to Paul's personal ministry: "He related one by one the things which God did among the Gentiles through his ministry."<br/>
C.　Colossians 4:17 says, "Take heed to the ministry which you have received in the Lord, that you fulfill it"; Archippus had a ministry, and in the same principle, we all have a ministry.<br/>
D.　In 2 Timothy 4:5 Paul charges Timothy to fully accomplish his ministry:<br/>
1.　For Timothy to fully accomplish his ministry was for him to fill up the full measure of his ministry.<br/>
2.　This ministry denotes the ministry of the word, which is to minister Christ in all His riches (Eph. 3:8) to both sinners and believers for the building up of the Body of Christ (4:11-12).<br/>
3.　Such a ministry is desperately needed to counter the trend of decline, as prophesied in 2 Timothy 4:3 and 4.<br/>
E.　Because the New Testament ministry is the service of the Body of Christ and because the Body has many members, every member has his own ministry—Eph. 4:11-12:<br/>
1.　According to the members, there are many ministries; however, according to the Body as a whole, there is just one ministry—1 Tim. 1:12.<br/>
2.　Our personal ministry should not be separate from the corporate ministry.<br/>
3.　The Body has a corporate ministry, and all the members of the Body have their individual ministries.<br/>
4.　As we have seen, all the ministries of the members of the Body added together equal the corporate ministry—Eph. 4:12.<br/>
F.　There should be the same speaking from different angles—1 Cor. 1:10:<br/>
1.　There is a need for many to be raised up to speak the same thing from different angles.<br/>
2.　We believe that the Lord will raise up many more to carry out the unique ministry—2 Cor. 4:1.<br/>
3.　We all have a part in this ministry, which is the one ministry with different functions, different angles, and different aspects—Eph. 4:11-12.<br/>
4.　We are not following a man or imitating anyone; however, we are ministering the same thing.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
III.　"For the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ"—v. 12:</p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
A.　The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherd-teachers (v. 11) are for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry mentioned in verse 12.<br/>
B.　The many gifted persons in verse 11 have only one ministry, that is, to minister Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ; this is the unique ministry in the New Testament economy—2 Cor. 4:1; 1 Tim. 1:12.<br/>
C.　The perfecting of the saints is unto the work of the ministry, and the work of the ministry is unto the building up of the Body of Christ—Eph. 4:12, 16.<br/>
D.　"This is the Lord's recovery, this is our commission, this is our burden, and this is our ministry. How blessed we are to have a part in this ministry!"—The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1978,vol. 3, "Truth Messages," p. 323.</p>
