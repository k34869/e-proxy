<p class="AA1">第五篇　享受基督作为新约禧年的实际</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">Enjoying Christ as the Reality of the New Testament Jubilee</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：利二五8～17，赛六一1～3，路四16～22，徒二六16～19</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　利未记二十五章八至十七节里的禧年，作为预言记载于以赛亚六十一章一至三节，并且实际地应验于路加四章十六至二十二节：─引用经文</p>
I.　The year of jubilee in Leviticus 25:8-17 is recorded as a prophecy in Isaiah 61:1-3 and is fulfilled in reality in Luke 4:16-22:
<p class="CC2">一　禧年有两项主要的福分，就是各人归回失去的产业，并从奴役得着释放─利二五8～17：</p>
A.　In the year of jubilee there were two main blessings: the returning of every man to his lost possession and the liberation from slavery—Lev. 25:8-17:
<p class="CC3">1　每一个卖了他所分得美地一分产业的，在禧年要归回自己的产业，而无须付赎价（10、13、28）；并且凡卖了自己作奴仆的，要重得自由，归回本家（39～41）。─引用经文</p>
1.　In the year of jubilee everyone who had sold his possession, his allotted portion of the good land, was returned to it without paying anything to redeem it (vv. 10, 13, 28), and everyone who had sold himself into slavery regained his freedom and returned to his family (vv. 39-41).
<p class="CC3">2　归回自己的产业以及得自由归回本家，表征在新约的禧年里，信徒已经归回神，就是他们所失去神圣的产业，并且从一切捆绑得释放，回到召会，就是他们神圣的家─弗一13～14，约八32、36，参诗六八5～6。</p>
2.　Returning to one's possession and being freed and returning to one's family signify that in the New Testament jubilee the believers have returned to God as their lost divine possession, have been released from all bondage, and have returned to the church as their divine family—Eph. 1:13-14; John 8:32, 36; cf. Psa. 68:5-6.
<p class="CC2">二　在旧约的预表里，禧年持续一年之久，其应验却是指整个新约时代，恩典时代，这是神悦纳归回之罪囚的时候（赛四九8，路十五17～24，林后六2），也是那些在罪的捆绑下受压制的人享受神救恩之释放的时候（罗七14～八2）。─引用经文</p>
B.　In the Old Testament type the jubilee lasted for one year, but in the fulfillment it refers to the entire New Testament age, the age of grace, as the time when God accepts the returned captives of sin (Isa. 49:8; Luke 15:17-24; 2 Cor. 6:2) and when those oppressed under the bondage of sin enjoy the release of God's salvation (Rom. 7:14—8:2).
<p class="CC2">三　信徒在恩典时代对禧年的享受，就是享受基督作为神给他们的恩典，这享受要带进千年国里对禧年完满的享受，以及在新天新地新耶路撒冷里最完满的享受─约一16～17，罗五17，腓三14，启二二1～2上。</p>
C.　The believers' enjoyment of the jubilee in the age of grace (their enjoyment of Christ as God's grace to them) will issue in the full enjoyment of the jubilee in the millennium and in the fullest enjoyment in the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth—John 1:16-17; Rom. 5:17; Phil. 3:14; Rev. 22:1-2a.
<p class="CC1">贰　禧年乃是基督作为恩典，借着祂的恩言分赐到我们里面，给我们享受的年代；新约的禧年乃是我们得救的狂喜年代─路四22，诗四五2，约一14～17，林后六2：</p>
II.　The year of jubilee is the age of Christ as grace dispensed into us for our enjoyment by His words of grace; the New Testament jubilee is an age of ecstasy for our salvation—Luke 4:22; Psa. 45:2; John 1:14-17; 2 Cor. 6:2:
<p class="CC2">一　新约时代就是狂喜年代，基督徒乃是狂喜的人；若是我们从来没有在神面前狂喜过，就表明我们对神的享受不够─五13，徒十一5，二二17，诗四三4上，五一12，彼前一8，赛十二3～6。</p>
A.　The New Testament age is an age of ecstasy, and a Christian is a person in ecstasy; if we have never been in ecstasy before God, this shows that we do not have a sufficient enjoyment of God— 5:13; Acts 11:5; 22:17; Psa. 43:4a; 51:12; 1 Pet. 1:8; Isa. 12:3-6.
<p class="CC2">二　“禧年”的意思就是无忧无虑、无牵无挂、无缺无乏、无病无灾，什么难处都没有，什么都是好处；因此，一切应心，万事如意，逍遥自在，狂喜欢腾─诗一〇三1～5，一一六1～7、12～13、17～19。</p>
B.　Jubilee means having no worry or anxiety, no concern or care, no lack or shortage, no sickness or calamity, and no problems whatsoever but, rather, having all benefits; hence, all things are pleasant and satisfying to our heart, and we are free from anxiety, at ease, excited, and exultant—Psa. 103:1-5; 116:1-7, 12-13, 17-19.
<p class="CC2">三　我们必须接受主耶稣在我们里面作真正的禧年；我们得着了祂，就有神作我们的产业，并且能蒙拯救脱离罪和撒但的辖制，而有真正的自由与安息─徒二六18，弗一13～14，西一12，太十一28，约八32、36：</p>
C.　We must receive the Lord Jesus as the real jubilee in us; if we have Him, we have God as our possession and can be delivered from the bondage of sin and Satan to have real freedom and rest—Acts 26:18; Eph. 1:13-14; Col. 1:12; Matt. 11:28; John 8:32, 36:
<p class="CC3">1　我们接受基督作我们的救主和生命时，祂就进到我们里面作我们的禧年，但我们若没有让基督在我们里面活着，也没有凭基督活着，我们就还没有实际地活在禧年里─利二五11～12。</p>
1.　When we receive Christ as our Savior and life, He comes into us to be our jubilee, but unless we allow Him to live in us and unless we live by Him, we are not practically living in the jubilee—vv. 11-12.
<p class="CC3">2　我们的心若放在主以外任何的人事物上，乃是拜偶像，结局都是苦恼─约壹五21，参结十四3、5，六9。</p>
2.　If our heart is set on any person, thing, or matter other than the Lord, this is idolatry, and the end is wretchedness—1 John 5:21; cf. Ezek. 14:3, 5; 6:9.
<p class="CC3">3　我们若让基督在我们里面活着，并凭祂活着，一切就都应心、如意；否则一切就都是难处，凡事都没有禧年。</p>
3.　If we allow Christ to live in us and we live by Him, everything is to our satisfaction; otherwise, everything is a problem, and nothing is a jubilee.
<p class="CC2">四　只有当这位包罗万有的基督给我们得着了，给我们享受了，我们才可能一切应心，万事如意；不是外面的人事物，乃是里面的基督，能叫我们安稳无忧地面对各样的环境─腓三8～9，四5～8、11～13。</p>
D.　Everything can be satisfying to us only after we have gained the all-inclusive Christ as our enjoyment; it is not outward persons, matters, or things but Christ within us who enables us to becalm and free of worries as we face all kinds of situations—Phil. 3:8-9; 4:5-8, 11-13.
<p class="CC1">叁　路加四章禧年的宣扬，控制了整卷路加福音的中心思想，而十章好撒玛利亚人的比喻和十五章浪子的比喻乃是禧年绝佳的例证：</p>
III.　The proclamation of the jubilee in Luke 4 governs the central thought of the whole Gospel of Luke, and the parables of the good Samaritan in Luke 10 and the prodigal son in Luke 15 are excellent illustrations of the jubilee:
<p class="CC2">一　好撒玛利亚人的比喻中所陈明的人救主，表征祂神圣属性带着人性美德的彰显─十25～37：</p>
A.　The Man-Savior presented in the parable of the good Samaritan signifies the expression of His divine attributes with His human virtues—10:25-37:
<p class="CC3">1　人救主在祂寻找失丧者并拯救罪人之职事的旅程中（十九10），来到被热中犹太教的强盗打伤，悲惨垂死的遭难者所在的地方。─引用经文</p>
1.　The Man-Savior, in His lost-one-seeking and sinner-saving ministry journey (19:10), came down to the place where the wounded victim of the Judaistic robbers lay in his miserable and dying condition.
<p class="CC3">2　人救主一看见他，就在祂带着神性的人性里动了慈心，给他温情的医治和拯救的照顾，完全应付了他的急需─十33～35。</p>
2.　When the Man-Savior saw him, He was moved with compassion in His humanity with His divinity and rendered him tender healing and saving care, fully meeting his urgent need— 10:33-35.
<p class="CC2">二　浪子的比喻中所陈明的人救主，表明祂牧养、寻找和拯救的灵，连同父施爱、赦免和怜恤的心─十五11～32，参九55～56：</p>
B.　The Man-Savior presented in the parable of the prodigal son shows His shepherding, seeking, and saving Spirit with the Father's loving, forgiving, and compassionate heart—15:11-32; cf. 9:55-56:
<p class="CC3">1　有一天浪子归回产业，回到父家，那就是禧年，就是自由；那也就是一切应心，万事如意─十五20、24，参利二五10～12。</p>
1.　One day the prodigal son returned to his possession and his father's house; that was a jubilee, a liberation, and everything became pleasant and satisfying—15:20, 24; cf. Lev. 25:10-12.
<p class="CC3">2　得救就是归回我们的产业，归回神，回来归向神，重新享受神作我们的产业（弗一13～14）；得救就是得着神；我们有了神，就什么都有了；我们没有神，就什么都没有了（西一12）。─引用经文</p>
2.　To be saved is to return to our inheritance, to return to God, to come back to God and enjoy Him anew as our possession (Eph. 1:13-14); to be saved is to gain God; when we have God, we have everything; without God, we have nothing (Col. 1:12).
<p class="CC3">3　神在基督里作了我们的福分，但许多基督徒不快乐，像灯不亮，因为他们的“开关没有打开”，没有以神作他们的分─弗四18，腓二12～16。</p>
3.　God has become our blessed portion in Christ, but many Christians are unhappy and are like lights that do not shine, because they do not "turn on the switch" by taking God as their portion—Eph. 4:18; Phil. 2:12-16.
<p class="CC3">4　父亲悦纳儿子，儿子回到父亲那里并归回父家，对儿子来说，这就是禧年，恩年─路十五20。</p>
4.　The father's acceptance of the son and the son's returning to his father and his father's house were the year of jubilee to the son, the year of grace—Luke 15:20.
<p class="CC3">5　神在基督里作了肥牛犊，给悔改归回的浪子享受─23节。</p>
5.　God in Christ has become the fattened calf for the enjoyment of the repentant and returned prodigal sons—v. 23.
<p class="CC3">6　这符合利未记二十五章十一至十二节，那里说，在禧年的时候不要种，也不要收，只要吃和享受；我们一悔改归向神，接受主耶稣，我们里面就真正得着神，这也就是我们禧年的开始。─引用经文</p>
6.　This corresponds to Leviticus 25:11-12, which says that the people were neither to sow nor reap in the year of the jubilee but only to eat and enjoy; once we repent and return to God by receiving the Lord Jesus, we obtain God within, and this is the beginning of our jubilee.
<p class="CC3">7　我们不是父亲的雇工，乃是享受祂的众子，我们能一直享受神作我们的产业，从现今直到永远。</p>
7.　We are not the Father's hired servants but His enjoying sons, and we can continually enjoy God as our possession from now unto eternity.
<p class="CC1">肆　我们需要享受基督作新约禧年之自由与祝福的实际─路四18～19：</p>
IV.　We need to enjoy Christ as the reality of the freedoms and blessings of the New Testament jubilee—Luke 4:18-19:
<p class="CC2">一　我们要享受基督作禧年的实际，就需要天天花时间在主面前，听祂的话并被祂灌注；我们需要跟随马利亚的榜样，在主脚前坐着听祂的话─十39：</p>
A.　In order to enjoy Christ as the reality of the jubilee, we need to spend time with the Lord day by day to listen to His word and be infused with Him; we need to follow the pattern of Mary, who sat at the Lord's feet and was listening to His word—10:39:
<p class="CC3">1　马利亚是坐在“主耶稣”的脚前，不是在别人的脚前；她亲近主；时时刻刻来到主面前，爱主，敬拜主，不住地与主交通，留在与主的同在中─没有一个办法能赶得上这一个。</p>
1.　She was at the feet of the Lord Jesus and not at the feet of anyone else; she was drawing near to the Lord; no method is better than coming to Him moment by moment, loving Him, worshipping Him, unceasingly fellowshipping with Him, and remaining in His presence.
<p class="CC3">2　马利亚是坐在主的“脚前”，意思是她把自己摆在一个谦卑的地位上，好领受主作恩典（彼前五5）；谦卑并非小看自己，乃是不看自己，没有自己，看自己等于零。─引用经文</p>
2.　She sat at the feet of the Lord, meaning that she put herself in a humble position in order to receive the Lord as grace (1 Pet. 5:5); humility is not belittling ourselves; humility is ignoring ourselves, negating ourselves, and considering ourselves as nothing.
<p class="CC3">3　她是“坐”着；安静在主面前常是属灵能力的来源（赛三十15上）；人常被眼睛和心思带到外面的世界去；那些忙乱的人，有流荡的心思和起伏的思潮，是最不容易得着启示的。─引用经文</p>
3.　She was sitting down; quietness before the Lord is often the source of spiritual strength (Isa. 30:15a); man's eyes and thoughts often are distracted to the outside world; those who are busy with a wandering mind and vacillating thoughts cannot receive revelation easily.
<p class="CC3">4　她在那里“听主的话”；主所说的话就是灵，就是生命（约六63），好将祂自己分赐给人；她听主的话，就给主机会将祂自己交通给她，好叫她一直接受主并得着主。─引用经文</p>
4.　She was listening to the Lord's word; the words that the Lord speaks are spirit and life (John 6:63) in order to dispense Himself into men; her listening to the Lord's word afforded the Lord the opportunity to communicate Himself to her so that she would continually receive the Lord and gain Him.
<p class="CC2">二　神的救恩使我们有真自由；我们的产业是神，我们的自由来自我们对神的享受；人若不享受神，是不会有真自由的；自由就是释放，就是脱开一切捆绑、一切重担、一切压制和一切辖制─八32、36，加五1，林后三17。</p>
B.　God's salvation causes us to have real freedom; our possession is God, and our freedom comes from our enjoyment of God; if man does not enjoy God, he cannot have real freedom; freedom means release, to be freed from all bondage, all heavy burden, all oppression, and all enslavement—8:32, 36; Gal. 5:1; 2 Cor. 3:17.
<p class="CC2">三　首先撒但把我们俘掳了，然后他就来住在我们里面，作我们犯罪的主动者、主使者；结果他就成了我们非法的主人，我们就作了他的俘虏，使我们好事不作，专作犯罪的事─罗七14，约壹五19：</p>
C.　First, Satan captured us; then he came to dwell in us as the inciter, the instigator, of our sins; the result is that he has become our illegal master, and we have become his captives to the extent that we are unable to do good and can only commit sins—Rom. 7:14; 1 John 5:19:
<p class="CC3">1　人若没有神，那么他在神以外所尝试享受的一切都是狗食、废物、粪土─腓三7～9，参彼后二22。</p>
1.　If a man does not have God, whatever he tries to enjoy apart from God is dog food, refuse, and dung—Phil. 3:7-9; cf. 2 Pet. 2:22.
<p class="CC3">2　撒但称为别西布尔（Beelzebul），意“粪堆之王”；这名源自“别西卜”（Beelzebub），意“苍蝇之王”；撒但专门带着罪人像苍蝇一样吃粪─太十25，十二24、27，王下一2。</p>
2.　Satan is called Beelzebul, which means "the lord of the dunghill," from Beelzebub, meaning "the lord of flies"; Satan specializes in leading sinners like flies to feed on dung—Matt. 10:25; 12:24, 27; 2 Kings 1:2.
<p class="CC3">3　人人心里实在都不愿意犯罪，结果个个都犯了罪，都身不由己，都成了罪的奴隶─罗七18～23，约八34。</p>
3.　Although deep in his heart no one wants to sin, eventually everyone sins; no one has control over himself, and everyone has become a slave of sin—Rom. 7:18-23; John 8:34.
<p class="CC2">四　保罗在罗马七章二十四节的迫切呼喊，在八章二节得着回答，那里说，生命之灵的律在基督耶稣里释放了我们，使我们脱离了罪与死的律。─引用经文</p>
D.　Paul's desperate cry in Romans 7:24 is answered in Romans 8:2, which says that the law of the Spirit of life frees us in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.
<p class="CC2">五　我们唯有享受基督作赐生命的灵，才能得着释放，才有真自由；唯有享受神的人能不犯罪，而有真自由，过一个自由、释放、脱离辖制的生活─约八11～12、24、28、31～36：</p>
E.　We can be released and have real freedom only by enjoying Christ as the life-giving Spirit; only those who enjoy God do not commit sin and are really free, living a life of liberty, release, and freedom from bondage—John 8:11-12, 24, 28, 31-36:
<p class="CC3">1　生命之灵的律释放我们，使我们脱离罪与死的律；这律就是主自己，祂经过死与复活，成了赐生命的灵─罗八2。</p>
1.　The law of the Spirit of life releases us from the law of sin and of death; this law is the Lord Himself, who passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit—Rom. 8:2.
<p class="CC3">2　如果我们享受主不够，就在许多事上还会受捆绑；立志没有用，我们一定要不断地来到主这里，吃祂并享受祂─林前一9，启二7，赛五五1～2。</p>
2.　If we do not enjoy the Lord sufficiently, we will still be in bondage to many things; making up our mind will not work; we must continually come to the Lord to eat and enjoy Him— 1 Cor. 1:9; Rev. 2:7; Isa. 55:1-2.
<p class="CC3">3　基督作为禧年释放我们脱离贫穷、被掳、瞎眼和受压制─传一2、14，三11，腓三8，彼后二22，路十二21，启三17。</p>
3.　Christ as the jubilee frees us from our poverty, captivity, blindness, and oppression—Eccl. 1:2, 14; 3:11; Phil. 3:8; 2 Pet. 2:22; Luke 12:21; Rev. 3:17.
<p class="CC2">六　禧年的生活乃是享受基督的生活，就是享受神作我们的基业和真自由的生活─徒二六18，约八36：</p>
F.　The living of the jubilee is a living in the enjoyment of Christ, a living of enjoying God as our inheritance and real freedom—Acts 26:18; John 8:36:
<p class="CC3">1　禧年的生活，就是我们在任何情况中都取用神自己，取用基督自己的生活；如此，祂就在我们里面作主因、作中心，带领我们克服人生一切的困扰─六16～21，西一17下、18下。</p>
1.　The living of the jubilee is a life in which we take God Himself, Christ Himself, in every situation; then He becomes the primary factor and center in us to overrule all the troubles of human life—6:16-21; Col. 1:17b, 18b; Phil. 4:6-7, 11-12.
<p class="CC3">2　因着一切都在祂的主宰之下，所以我们应该祷告说，“主啊，求你充满我，得着我，占有我；不管外面情况如何，我就是要享受你”；我们需要成为今日的执事和见证人，活出并宣扬福音─基督是恩典的禧年─以完成神永远的经纶─徒二六16～19。</p>
2.　Because everything is under His sovereignty, we should pray, "Lord, fill me, gain me, and possess me; no matter what my outward situation is, I just want to enjoy You"; we need to be today's ministers and witnesses by living and proclaiming the gospel—Christ as the jubilee of grace—for the accomplishing of God's eternal economy—Acts 26:16-19.
