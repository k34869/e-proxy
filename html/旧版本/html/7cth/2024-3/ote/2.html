<p style="text-align:center;color:#338833;">Message Two<br/>A Grafted Life</p>
<p style="color:#999999;">Scripture Reading: John 15:1, 4-5; Rom. 11:17-24; 1 Cor. 6:17</p>
<p class="CC3">I.　As believers in Christ, we should live a grafted life—a life in which we are one spirit with the Lord and live in an organic union with Him—1 Cor. 6:17; John 15:4.</p>
<p class="CC3">II.　The Bible reveals that the relationship God desires to have with man is that He and man become one—1 Cor. 6:17:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　God desires that the divine life and the human life be joined together to become one life— John 15:1, 4-5.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　This oneness is an organic union, a union in life—a grafted life.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　The concept of the divine life and the human life being grafted into one is mysterious, beyond the natural concept, and foreign to human thought.</p>
<p class="CC3">III.　In grafting, two similar lives are joined and then grow together—Rom. 11:17-24:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　Grafting can be effective only if the lives to be grafted are similar.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　Because our human life was made in the image of God and according to the likeness of God, it can be joined to the divine life.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　Our human life resembles the divine life; therefore, the divine life and the human life can be grafted together and then grow together organically.</p>
<p class="CC3">IV.　In order for us to be grafted into Christ, He had to pass through the processes of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　Christ became flesh to be the seed of David, the branch of David, the Shoot, so that we might be grafted together with Him; He became the same as we are so that He and we could be grafted together—John 1:14; Matt. 1:1; Zech. 3:8; Jer. 23:5; 33:15.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　Christ was "cut" on the cross so that we could be grafted into Him:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Christ's becoming the branch of David does not by itself mean that He could be grafted together with us.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Grafting requires cutting; two branches cannot be grafted together unless both are cut:</p>
<p class="CC4">a.　Christ was cut when He died on the cross.</p>
<p class="CC4">b.　We were cut when we repented and received the Lord.</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　After the cutting occurs, the joining and the organic union take place; therefore, in grafting we have the cutting, the joining, and the organic union.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　After Christ was cut on the cross, He was resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit— 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　By becoming such a Spirit, Christ was ready for grafting.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Once we repent and receive the Lord, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit, bringing the divine life into us, and we are grafted together with Christ— John 20:22; Rom. 8:11:</p>
<p class="CC4">a.　This life is a life of death and resurrection.</p>
<p class="CC4">b.　As the life-giving Spirit, Christ brings the key to death and resurrection into us, the believers, that we may die and be raised with Christ—Gal. 2:20.</p>
<p class="CC4">c.　In this death and resurrection we are grafted together with Christ.</p>
<p class="CC3">V.　As regenerated ones, we should live a grafted life—a life in which two parties are joined to grow organically—John 15:1, 4-5:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　After we have been grafted into Christ, we should no longer live by ourselves; rather, we should allow the pneumatic Christ to live in us—Gal. 2:20.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　We should no longer live by our flesh or by our natural being; instead, we should live by our regenerated spirit, a spirit grafted with Christ—Rom. 8:4.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　Through this grafting we are united with Him, mingled with Him, and incorporated with Him to become the Body of Christ—12:4-5.</p>
<p class="CC3">VI.　The grafted life is not an exchanged life but the mingling of the human life with the divine life—Gal. 2:20:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　The concept of the exchanged life is that we yield our human life to the Lord, and He replaces it with His divine life.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　The Christian life is not an exchanged life but a grafted life—the mingling of the human life with the divine life—Rom. 6:3-5; John 15:1, 4-5:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　There is no exchange, or trade, of lives.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Instead of exchange there is the dispensing, the infusing, of the divine life into the human life and the mingling of the divine life with the human life.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　The most wonderful reality in the Christian experience is that the believers in Christ are united with Christ in the way of life—1 Cor. 6:17:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Whatever Christ is and whatever He has done are altogether for one thing: that He and we could be organically united and live a grafted life—John 15:4-5.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　In His recovery the Lord is recovering this neglected matter of the grafted life.</p>
<p class="CC3">VII.　In the grafted life the human life is not eliminated but is strengthened, uplifted, and enriched by the divine life—Rom. 11:17-24:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　In the grafted life the branch still retains its same essential characteristics, but its life is uplifted and transformed by being grafted into a better life:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　The higher life subdues the lower life.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　The higher life enriches, uplifts, and transforms the lower life.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　In the grafted life the divine life works within us to discharge the negative elements— 2 Cor. 3:18:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　The divine life works in a gradual way to eliminate whatever is natural.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　The negative element in our disposition is killed, and then, instead of casting away our disposition, the Lord uplifts it and uses it.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　In the grafted life the divine life resurrects God's original creation—John 11:25:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Instead of giving up His creation, God will reclaim it.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　God intends to bring all the aspects of our being into resurrection—Phil. 3:11:</p>
<p class="CC4">a.　As the divine life discharges the negative things, it works to resurrect God's original creation.</p>
<p class="CC4">b.　In this way our original functions—the functions given us at creation—are restored, strengthened, and enriched—Gal. 2:20.</p>
<p class="CC3">D.　In the grafted life the divine life supplies the riches of Christ to our inward parts— Rom. 12:2:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Our resurrected and uplifted faculties are supplied with the riches of Christ.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Through such a supply we are renewed in our mind, emotion, and will.</p>
<p class="CC3">E.　In the grafted life the divine life saturates our whole being—8:29-30:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　The riches of Christ saturate us and transform us—12:2; 2 Cor. 3:18.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　By this saturation of the divine life we are conformed to the image of Christ—Rom. 8:29.</p>
