Christ Nullifying Death and Bringing Life and Incorruption to Light, and Our Remembering Jesus Christ, the Seed of David, Raised from the Dead</p>
<p style="text-align:center;font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#2040A0;">

<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#999999;">
Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 1:10; 2:8; Acts 2:24; Heb. 2:9, 14; 7:16</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
I.　"Our Savior Christ Jesus, who nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel"—2 Tim. 1:10:</p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
A.　In 2 Timothy 1:10 Paul tells us that Christ nullified death:<br/>
1.　This means that Christ made death of none effect through His devil-destroying death (Heb. 2:14) and death-swallowing resurrection (1 Cor. 15:52-54).<br/>
2.　Christ not only defeated death—He nullified it—2 Tim. 1:10.<br/>
3.　Christ was manifested to nullify death and to bring in eternal, indestructible life—Heb. 7:16.<br/>
4.　Through His resurrection, death has become of none effect; death has lost its power, even its taste—2:9; Acts 2:24.<br/>
5.　Christ could nullify death because He destroyed the devil, the one who has the might of death—Heb. 2:14:<br/>
a.　By overcoming Satan and nullifying death, the Lord Jesus also defeated Hades and the grave—Rev. 1:18.<br/>
b.　Therefore, Christ's resurrection was not only God's vindication and the Lord's success but also His victory over death, Satan, Hades, and the grave— 20:14.<br/>
B.　Having nullified death through His death, the Lord Jesus brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel in His resurrection—2 Tim. 1:10:<br/>
1.　The last part of 2 Timothy 1:10 speaks of Christ Jesus who brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel.<br/>
2.　In the gospel the revelation is brought to us that Christ has nullified death and has brought us eternal, indestructible life—v. 10.<br/>
3.　Life in 2 Timothy 1:10 refers to the eternal life of God, which is given to all believers in Christ (1 Tim. 1:16) and which is the main element of the divine grace given to us (Rom. 5:17, 21):<br/>
a.　This life has conquered death (Acts 2:24) and will swallow up death (2 Cor. 5:4).<br/>
b.　Life is the divine element, even God Himself, imparted into our spirit; incorruption is the consequence of life's saturating our body, giving life to our mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells us.<br/>
c.　This life and incorruption are able to counter death and corruption—2 Tim. 1:10.</p>
<p style="font-weight:bold;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
II.　"Remember Jesus Christ, raised from the dead, of the seed of David, according to my gospel"—2:8:</p>
<p style="font-weight:normal;font-style:normal;font-size:16pt;color:#000000;">
A.　The Lord Jesus Christ was raised from the dead—v. 8:<br/>
1.　In 2 Timothy 2:8 the word raised indicates Christ's victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power.<br/>
2.　Regarding the Lord Jesus as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead—Rom. 8:11.<br/>
3.　Regarding the Lord Jesus as God, the New Testament tells us that He Himself rose from the dead—Acts 10:41; 1 Thes. 4:14.<br/>
4.　Christ's being raised from the dead and His raising Himself from the dead indicate His dual status—human and divine:<br/>
a.　The Lord Jesus is God and also resurrection (John 1:1; 11:25), possessing the indestructible life (Heb. 7:16).<br/>
b.　Because Christ is the ever-living One, death was notable to hold Him.<br/>
c.　He delivered Himself to death, but death could not detain Him.<br/>
d.　Rather, death was defeated by Him, and He rose up from it—Acts 2:24.<br/>
5.　On the day of His resurrection, early in the morning, the Lord Jesus ascended to satisfy the Father; the freshness of His resurrection was first for the Father's enjoyment, as the firstfruits of the harvest were, in type, brought first to God— John 20:17; cf. Lev. 23:10-11; Exo. 23:19a.<br/>
6.　Another aspect of Christ's work in His resurrection is His rising on the first day of the week to germinate the new creation—2 Cor. 5:17:<br/>
a.　The fact that Christ arose on the first day of the week indicates that the entire universe has a new beginning in Christ's resurrection—John 20:1-9.<br/>
b.　Christ's resurrection ushered in a new period, a new age.<br/>
c.　In the sight of God, the entire old creation was crucified with Christ and buried with Him; then on the first day of the week there was a new beginning.<br/>
d.　Whereas the Lord's death was the termination of the old creation, His resurrection was the germination of the new creation—2 Cor. 5:17.<br/>
B.　The expression seed of David indicates Christ's dignified human nature, which was exalted and glorified along with His divine nature—Rom. 1:3-4:<br/>
1.　The prophecy in 2 Samuel 7:12-14a says that the seed of David would be the Son of God, and God would be His Father.<br/>
2.　In other words, a human seed would become the divine Son—v. 14a.<br/>
3.　The word concerning your seed in verse 12 and My son in verse 14 implies that the seed of David would become a divine Son:<br/>
a.　This word corresponds to Paul's word in Romans 1:3-4 concerning Christ as the seed of David being designated the Son of God in His humanity in resurrection.<br/>
b.　It also relates to the Lord's question in Matthew 22:41-45 concerning how the Christ could be both the son of David and the Son of God as David's Lord—a wonderful person, a God-man with two natures, divinity and humanity.<br/>
c.　These verses clearly unveil that a seed of man—that is, a son of man— can become the Son of God.<br/>
d.　God Himself, the divine One, became a human seed, the seed of a man, David.<br/>
e.　This seed was Jesus, the God-man, Jehovah the Savior (1:18-21; 2 Tim. 2:8), who was the Son of God by virtue of His divinity (Luke 1:35).<br/>
f.　Through His resurrection He as the human seed became the Son of God in His humanity—Rom. 1:3-4.<br/>
g.　In Christ God was constituted into man, man was constituted into God, and God and man were mingled together to be one entity, the God-man.<br/>
h.　This implies that God's intention in His economy is to make Himself man in order to make man God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead— John 3:6, 16; Rom. 1:3-4; 2 Pet. 1:4.</p>
