<p class="AA2">总题：享受基督与在生命里长大以至成熟</p>
<p class="AA1">第二篇　基督作为那行为受属天管治者、我们的牧人、我们的安息以及那撒种者</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">Christ as the One with the Heavenly-ruled Deeds, Our Shepherd, Our Rest, and the Sower</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：太九20～22、36，十一28～30，十三3、18～23</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　基督被启示为那行为受属天管治者─祂的衣服穗子─太九20～22：</p>
I.　Christ is revealed as the One with the heavenly-ruled deeds— the fringe of His garment—Matt. 9:20-22:
<p class="CC2">一　基督的衣服象征祂的义行，穗子象征属天的管治：“你要告诉以色列人，叫他们世世代代在衣服边上作穗子，又在衣边的穗子上钉一根蓝细带子。这穗子是要叫你们一看见，就记念并遵行耶和华一切的命令，……成为圣别，归与你们的神”─民十五38～40：</p>
A.　Christ's garment signifies His righteous deeds, and the fringe signifies the heavenly ruling: "Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make for themselves fringes on the borders of their garments throughout their generations and to put on the fringe of each border a cord of blue. And it shall be a fringe for you, so that when you see it you will remember all the commandments of Jehovah and do them…and be holy to your God"—Num. 15:38-40:
<p class="CC3">1　带子象征约束，蓝色象征属天。</p>
1.　A cord signifies binding, and blue signifies heavenly.
<p class="CC3">2　因此，蓝细带子象征我们是神的儿女，行为举止该是美好的，也该在属天行政、限制和规范的管理、管治并约束之下。</p>
2.　Hence, a cord of blue signifies that, as children of God, our conduct and behavior should be beautiful and should be under the ruling, governing, and binding of the heavenly government, limitation, and regulation.
<p class="CC2">二　衣服象征人行为的美德；主的衣服象征祂在人性里的完美行为，就是祂人性美德的完全。</p>
B.　Garments signify virtue in human behavior; the Lord's garments signify His perfect behavior in His humanity, His human virtuous perfection.
<p class="CC2">三　在主耶稣人性的美德里，有医治的能力；因此，当那有病的女人摸祂的衣服穗子，祂美德的能力就出来临到她，她便得了医治。</p>
C.　In the human virtue of the Lord Jesus, there was healing power; therefore, when the sick woman touched the fringe of His garment, the power of His virtue went out to her, and she was healed.
<p class="CC2">四　基督受属天管治的行为所生出的美德，成了医治的能力─太十四36。</p>
D.　Out of Christ's heavenly-ruled deeds issues the virtue that becomes the healing power—Matt. 14:36.
<p class="CC2">五　摸主的衣服，事实上就是摸那在祂人性里的主自己，而神是具体化在祂的人性里（西二9）；借着这样一摸，祂神圣的能力就借着祂人性的完全，传输到摸的人里面，成为她的医治（路八45～48，来十二2上）。─引用经文</p>
E.　To touch the Lord's garments was actually to touch Him in His humanity, in which God was embodied (Col. 2:9); by such a touch, His divine power was transfused, through the perfection of His humanity, into the one who had touched Him, and it became her healing (Luke 8:45-48; Heb. 12:2a).
<p class="CC2">六　那住在不能靠近之光中的神，在奴仆救主里，借着祂的人性成了可摸的，叫那女人得救并给她享受。</p>
F.　The God who dwells in unapproachable light became touchable in the Slave-Savior through His humanity for her salvation and enjoyment.
<p class="CC2">七　拥挤的群众从奴仆救主一无所得，但摸祂的人却有所得（见诗歌四一二首第二节与副歌）。─引用经文</p>
G.　The pressing crowd did not receive anything from the Slave-Savior, but the one who touched Him did (see Hymns, #559, stanza 2 and chorus).
<p class="CC1">贰　主耶稣是我们的牧人，我们是祂的羊─太九36，赛四十11，五三6，结三四1～5、11～15：</p>
II.　The Lord Jesus is our Shepherd, and we are His sheep—Matt. 9:36; Isa. 40:11; 53:6; Ezek. 34:1-5, 11-15:
<p class="CC2">一　祂在起初阶段牧养我们，使我们享受基督作青草地，并那灵作可安歇的水─诗二三1～2，提前一4，腓一19下，约二一15，帖前二7，林前十二13下。</p>
A.　He shepherds us in the initial stage of the enjoyment of Christ as the green pastures and of the Spirit as the waters of rest— Psa. 23:1-2; 1 Tim. 1:4; Phil. 1:19b; John 21:15; 1 Thes. 2:7; 1 Cor. 12:13b.
<p class="CC2">二　祂在第二阶段牧养我们，使我们在义路上得复兴和变化─诗二三3，罗十二2，约七38，罗八4。</p>
B.　He shepherds us in the second stage of the revival and transformation on the paths of righteousness—Psa. 23:3; Rom. 12:2; John 7:38; Rom. 8:4.
<p class="CC2">三　祂在第三阶段牧养我们，使我们行过死荫的幽谷时，经历那复活、是灵之基督的同在─诗二三4，提后四22，林后十二7～10。</p>
C.　He shepherds us in the third stage of the experience of the presence of the resurrected pneumatic Christ while walking through the valley of the shadow of death—Psa. 23:4; 2 Tim. 4:22; 2 Cor. 12:7-10.
<p class="CC2">四　祂在第四阶段牧养我们，使我们更深、更高地享受复活的基督─诗二三5：</p>
D.　He shepherds us in the fourth stage of the deeper and higher enjoyment of the resurrected Christ—Psa. 23:5:
<p class="CC3">1　主在我们敌人面前为我们摆设筵席─5节上，参撒下四4，九7、13，创十四18～20，尼四17。</p>
1.　The Lord spreads a table before us in the presence of our adversaries—v. 5a; cf. 2 Sam. 4:4; 9:7, 13; Gen. 14:18-20; Neh. 4:17.
<p class="CC3">2　主用油膏了我们的头，使我们的福杯满溢─诗二三5下，来一9，林前十16上、21。</p>
2.　The Lord anoints our head with oil, and our cup runs over— Psa. 23:5b; Heb. 1:9; 1 Cor. 10:16a, 21.
<p class="CC3">3　在诗篇二十三篇五节我们有三一神─子是筵席，那灵是膏油，父是祝福的源头。</p>
3.　In Psalm 23:5 we have the Triune God—the Son as the feast, the Spirit as the anointing oil, and the Father as the source of blessing.
<p class="CC2">五　祂在第五阶段牧养我们，使我们在耶和华殿中一生享受神圣的恩惠和慈爱─6节：</p>
E.　He shepherds us in the fifth stage of the lifelong enjoyment of the divine goodness and lovingkindness in the house of Jehovah— v. 6:
<p class="CC3">1　在是灵的基督生机的牧养下，我们一生一世必有恩惠慈爱随着我们，并且我们要住在耶和华的殿中，直到永远─6节：</p>
1.　Under the organic shepherding of the pneumatic Christ, goodness and lovingkindness will follow us all the days of our life, and we will dwell in the house of Jehovah for the length of our days—v. 6:
<p class="CC4">a　“恩惠”指基督的恩，“慈爱”指父的爱，“随着”含示那灵的交通；因此，子的恩、父的爱和那灵的交通与我们同在─林后十三14。</p>
a.　Goodness refers to the grace of Christ, lovingkindness refers to the love of the Father, and follow implies the fellowship of the Spirit; thus, the grace of the Son, the love of the Father, and the fellowship of the Spirit are with us—2 Cor. 13:14.
<p class="CC4">b　对经过过程并终极完成之三一神的享受，将我们引到神的殿（基督、召会、我们的灵与新耶路撒冷─约一14，二21，提前三15～16，弗二22，启二一2～3、22）中对神的享受；我们要住在神的殿中，直到永远（今世、来世和永世）。─引用经文</p>
b.　The enjoyment of the processed and consummated Triune God ushers us into the enjoyment of God in the house of God (Christ, the church, our spirit, and the New Jerusalem— John 1:14; 2:21; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Eph. 2:22; Rev. 21:2-3, 22) where we will dwell for the length of our days (in the present age, in the coming age, and in eternity).
<p class="CC3">2　我们需要寻求一生一世住在神的殿中─诗二七4～8：</p>
2.　We need to seek to dwell in the house of God all the days of our life—Psa. 27:4-8:
<p class="CC4">a　瞻仰神的荣美（可爱，可悦，可喜）─4节上、8节，林后三18。</p>
a.　To behold the beauty (loveliness, pleasantness, delightfulness) of God—vv. 4a, 8; 2 Cor. 3:18.
<p class="CC4">b　求问神，与祂核对我们日常生活中的每件事─诗二七4下，参书九14。</p>
b.　To inquire of God, checking with Him about everything in our daily life—Psa. 27:4b; cf. Josh. 9:14.
<p class="CC4">c　被隐藏在神的遮蔽处，并将自己藏匿在神帐幕的隐密处─诗二七5上，三一20。</p>
c.　To be concealed in God's shelter and to hide ourselves in the hiding place of God's tent—Psa. 27:5a; 31:20.
<p class="CC4">d　被神高举，并因神得以昂首─二七5下～6上。</p>
d.　To be raised up and have our head lifted up by God— 27:5b-6a.
<p class="CC4">e　献欢呼的祭，并唱诗歌颂神，使神得荣耀─6节下，来十三15，腓二11。</p>
e.　To offer sacrifices of shouts of joy with singing and psalming to God for the glory of God—v. 6b; Heb. 13:15; Phil. 2:11.
<p class="CC1">叁　主耶稣是我们的安息─太十一28～30：</p>
III.　The Lord Jesus is our rest—Matt. 11:28-30:
<p class="CC2">一　“凡劳苦担重担的，可以到我这里来，我必使你们得安息”─28节：</p>
A.　"Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest"—v. 28:
<p class="CC3">1　这里所提到的劳苦，不仅是指为了遵守律法诫命和宗教规条而努力的劳苦，也是指为了工作成功而奋斗的劳苦；凡这样劳苦的，总是担重担的。</p>
1.　The toil mentioned here refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work; whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened.
<p class="CC3">2　安息不仅是指从律法与宗教，或工作与责任的劳苦并重担中得着释放，也是指完全的平安和完满的满足。</p>
2.　Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law or religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.
<p class="CC2">二　“我心里柔和谦卑，因此你们要负我的轭，且要跟我学，你们魂里就必得安息；因为我的轭是容易的，我的担子是轻省的”─29～30节：</p>
B.　"Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For My yoke is easy and My burden is light"—vv. 29-30:
<p class="CC3">1　负主的轭就是接受父的旨意；这不是受任何工作的规律或支配，乃是受父旨意的约束。</p>
1.　To take the Lord's yoke is to take the will of the Father; it is not to be regulated or controlled by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father.
<p class="CC3">2　主过这样的生活，并不在意别的，只在意祂父的旨意（约四34，五30，六38）；祂将自己完全降服于父的旨意（太二六39、42）；因此，祂要我们跟祂学。─引用经文</p>
2.　The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father (John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38); He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will (Matt. 26:39, 42); hence, He asks us to learn from Him.
<p class="CC3">3　跟祂学，不是外面模仿祂，乃是在我们的灵里借着负祂的轭─神的旨意─来翻印祂；神的旨意必须成为我们的轭，我们也必须将自己的颈项放在这轭内，好成为祂的复制─彼前二21。</p>
3.　To learn from Him is not to imitate Him outwardly but to copy the Lord in our spirit by taking His yoke—God's will; God's will has to yoke us, and we have to put our neck into this yoke to become His duplication—1 Pet. 2:21.
<p class="CC3">4　负主的轭、跟主学，就叫我们的魂得安息；这是里面的安息，不是任何仅仅在本质上是外面的事物。</p>
4.　The rest that we find by taking the Lord's yoke and learning from Him is for our souls; it is an inward rest and not anything merely outward in nature.
<p class="CC3">5　主的轭是父的旨意，祂的担子是将父旨意实行出来的工作；这样的轭是容易（美好、亲切、柔和、温良、愉快，与艰难、严酷、尖锐、痛苦相对）的；这样的担子是轻省的，不是沉重的。</p>
5.　The Lord's yoke is the Father's will, and His burden is the work of carrying out the Father's will; such a yoke is easy (good, kind, mild, gentle, pleasant—in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, bitter), and such a burden is light, not heavy.
<p class="CC1">肆　那撒种者乃是主耶稣这奇妙的人位；所撒的种子也是主自己这三一神的具体化身─太十三3、18～23：</p>
IV.　The Sower is the wonderful person of the Lord Jesus, and the seed sown is also the Lord Himself as the embodiment of the Triune God—Matt. 13:3, 18-23:
<p class="CC2">一　我们需要看见基督这撒种者的异象，祂将自己当作生命的种子撒在人里面；这异象正是主恢复的心脏，因为这联于主心头的愿望。</p>
A.　We need to see the vision of Christ, the Sower, sowing Himself as the seed of life into human beings; this vision is the very heart of the Lord's recovery, for it is related to the desire of the Lord's heart.
<p class="CC2">二　祂渴望进到我们这些祂所拣选的人里面，用调和的方式作我们的生命，为了使祂自己成为我们的元素，并使我们成为祂的彰显。</p>
B.　He desires to come into us, His chosen people, to be our life in the way of mingling in order to make Himself our element and to make us His expression.
<p class="CC2">三　在基督里得了重生，有神生命的信徒，乃是神所耕种的田地，神新造里的农场，生长基督，好为着神的建造，产生宝贵的材料─林前三9、12上。</p>
C.　The believers, who have been regenerated in Christ with God's life, are God's cultivated land, a farm in God's new creation to grow Christ so that precious materials maybe produced for God's building—1 Cor. 3:9, 12a.
<p class="CC2">四　按照圣经，长大等于建造；这建造是借着我们里面神圣生命的种子长大而进行的─约壹三9，西二19，弗四15～16。</p>
D.　According to the Bible, growth equals building; this takes place by the growth of the divine seed of life within us—1 John 3:9; Col. 2:19; Eph. 4:15-16.
<p class="CC2">五　以弗所三章十七节启示，三一神已经进到我们里面，以祂自己作元素，并以一些出于我们的东西作材料，来作建造的工作；马太十三章撒种者的比喻说明了这事：─引用经文</p>
E.　Ephesians 3:17 reveals that the Triune God has come into us to do a building work with Himself as the element and also with something from us as the material; this is illustrated by the parable of the sower in Matthew 13:
<p class="CC3">1　主将自己当作生命的种子，撒在人的心这土壤里，使祂能生长并活在他们里面，且从他们里面彰显出来─3节。</p>
1.　The Lord sows Himself as the seed of life into men's hearts, the soil, that He might grow and live in them and be expressed from within them—v. 3.
<p class="CC3">2　种子撒到土里，是凭土壤里的养分而长大；结果，种子的出产乃是由种子和土壤的元素所组成─23节。</p>
2.　The seed is sown into the soil to grow with the nutrients of the soil; as a result, the produce is a composition of elements from both the seed and the soil—v. 23.
<p class="CC3">3　在我们里面有一些养分是神所造的，预备让祂进到我们里面，在我们里面长大；为着神圣的种子，神造了人的灵，有属人的养分，连同人的心作为土壤─彼前三4。</p>
3.　We have within us certain nutrients created by God as a preparation for His coming into us to grow in us; God has created the human spirit with the human nutrients along with the human heart as the soil for the divine seed—1 Pet. 3:4.
<p class="CC3">4　我们在生命里长大的速度，不在于神圣的种子，乃在于我们供应这种子多少的养分；我们供应的养分越多，种子就长得越快，并且越茂盛─太五3、8。</p>
4.　The rate at which we grow in life depends not on the divine seed but on how many nutrients we afford this seed; the more nutrients we supply, the faster the seed will grow and the more it will flourish—Matt. 5:3, 8.
<p class="CC3">5　我们若留在魂里，留在天然的人里，就没有任何养分为着神圣种子的长大；但我们若得加强到里面的人里，并且注意我们的灵，操练我们的灵，就能够供应养分；这样基督就能安家在我们心里─弗三16～17，罗八6，提前四7，参犹19。</p>
5.　If we remain in our soul, in our natural man, there will not be any nutrients for the growth of the divine seed, but if we are strengthened into our inner man and if we pay attention to our spirit and exercise our spirit, the nutrients will be supplied and Christ will make His home in our hearts—Eph. 3:16-17; Rom. 8:6; 1 Tim. 4:7; cf. Jude 19.
<p class="CC3">6　我们若要让主这生命的种子在我们里面长大，成为我们完满的享受，就必须向主完全敞开，并与祂合作，彻底对付我们的心─太十三3～9、18～23。</p>
6.　If we are going to have the Lord as the seed of life grow within us to be our full enjoyment, we have to open to the Lord absolutely and cooperate with Him to deal thoroughly with our heart—Matt. 13:3-9, 18-23.
<p class="CC3">7　一面，神用祂自己作元素加强我们；另一面，我们提供养分；借着这二者，神在基督里就在我们的全人里完成祂内在的建造，就是建造祂的家。</p>
7.　On the one hand, God strengthens us with Himself as the element, and on the other hand, we afford the nutrients; through these two, God in Christ carries out His intrinsic building— the building of His home—in our entire being.
