<p class="AA1">第七篇　生命的粮</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">The Bread of Life</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：约六22～71</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　我们若仔细读过约翰六章，应该对这章有深刻的印象，也该注意七个重点的次序：</p>
I.　If we read John 6 carefully, we should have a deep impression of this chapter and pay attention to the sequence of seven crucial points:
<p class="CC2">一　主是生命的粮─35、48节。</p>
A.　The Lord is the bread of life—vv. 35, 48.
<p class="CC2">二　主把祂生命的粮赐给我们吃─51节。</p>
B.　The Lord gives His bread of life for us to eat—v. 51.
<p class="CC2">三　主还把祂的血给我们喝─53节。</p>
C.　The Lord also gives His blood for us to drink—v. 53.
<p class="CC2">四　主不仅死了，也复活了─56节。</p>
D.　The Lord not only died but also resurrected—v. 56.
<p class="CC2">五　因着基督活在我们里面，我们就因祂活着，并且活在神面前─57节。</p>
E.　Because Christ lives in us, we live because of Him and live before God—v. 57.
<p class="CC2">六　不是祂物质的肉，乃是祂的灵，赐我们生命和生命的供应─63节上。</p>
F.　His Spirit, not His physical flesh, gives us life and the life supply—v. 63a.
<p class="CC2">七　那灵乃是在主所说的话里面；祂的话就是灵，就是生命─63节下。</p>
G.　The Spirit is in the Lord's spoken words; His words are spirit and life—v. 63b.
<p class="CC1">贰　主耶稣从天上降到地上来，最主要的目的是要成就一件中心的事，就是把祂自己当作食物（生命的粮）赐给我们，好使我们能吃祂作属灵的养分，并消化祂而使祂成为我们的构成─50～51节。</p>
II.　The primary purpose for which the Lord Jesus came down out of heaven to the earth was to accomplish one central matter— to give Himself to us as food—the bread of life—so that He could be eaten by us as spiritual nourishment and be digested by us to become our constitution—vv. 50-51.
<p class="CC1">叁　约翰六章详论主耶稣作生命的粮；祂宣告说，“我就是生命的粮”─48节：</p>
III.　Chapter 6 of the Gospel of John is a detailed discourse on the Lord Jesus being the bread of life; He declared, "I am the bread of life"—v. 48:
<p class="CC2">一　在六章，有许多经节启示基督是生命的粮，为要给我们经历并享受─27、32～35、47～58、63节上，68节：</p>
A.　Many verses in John 6 reveal that, for our experience and enjoyment, Christ is the bread of life—vv. 27, 32-35, 47-58, 63a, 68b:
<p class="CC3">1　约翰六章整章最重要的点乃是，基督是我们的食物，是生命的粮─35、48节。</p>
1.　The most important point in the entire chapter of John 6 is that Christ is our food, the bread of life—vv. 35, 48.
<p class="CC3">2　吃主不是一次永远的事；反之，我们每日都需要接触主并吃主，因为祂是可吃的─50节。</p>
2.　To eat Him is not a once-for-all matter; rather, we need to contact the Lord and eat Him daily, for He is edible—v. 50.
<p class="CC3">3　我们需要操练我们的灵，从祂得喂养，接受祂，消化祂，经历祂，享受祂，并且每时每刻应用祂─56～57节。</p>
3.　We need to exercise our spirit to feed on Him, receiving Him, digesting Him, experiencing Him, enjoying Him, and applying Him moment by moment—vv. 56-57.
<p class="CC3">4　我们都该专注于一件事─吃基督，然后凭着我们所吃的基督而活─54节。</p>
4.　We all should concentrate on one thing—eating Christ and then living by what we have eaten of Him—v. 54.
<p class="CC2">二　“不要为那必坏的食物劳力，要为那存到永远生命的食物劳力，就是人子要赐给你们的”─27节：</p>
B.　"Work not for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides unto eternal life, which the Son of Man will give you"— v. 27:
<p class="CC3">1　永远的生命就是神的生命，神非受造的生命，不仅在时间上是永久的，在性质上也是永远、神圣的─三15。</p>
1.　Eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which not only is everlasting with respect to time but also is eternal and divine in nature—3:15.
<p class="CC3">2　那存到永远生命的食物能供应我们，并将我们带进永远的生命─六27。</p>
2.　The food which abides unto eternal life can supply us and bring us into eternal life—6:27.
<p class="CC2">三　“我父把那从天上来的真粮赐给你们。因为神的粮，就是那从天上降下来赐生命给世人的”─32～33节：</p>
C.　"My Father gives you the true bread out of heaven. For the bread of God is He who comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world"—vv. 32-33:
<p class="CC3">1　只有属灵的事才是真实的；“那灵就是实际”─约壹五6下。</p>
1.　Only spiritual things are real; "the Spirit is the reality"— 1.John 5:6b.
<p class="CC3">2　基督作为真粮，乃是真理、实际的粮；基督是真实、实际的。</p>
2.　As the true bread, Christ is the bread of truth, of reality; Christ is true, real.
<p class="CC3">3　我们都需要对这事实有深刻的印象：我们需要基督作生命的真粮，为神所差，将永远的生命带给我们。</p>
3.　We all need to be deeply impressed with the fact that we need Christ as the true bread of life sent by God to bring us eternal life.
<p class="CC3">4　约翰六章三十三节里“神的粮”就是三十二节里的“真粮”。─引用经文</p>
4.　"The bread of God" in John 6:33 is "the true bread" in verse 32.
<p class="CC3">5　基督作为从天上降下来的粮，乃是属天的粮；祂作为神的粮，乃是属神的，是受神差遣，也与神同在的─33节。</p>
5.　As the bread that came down out of heaven, Christ is the heavenly bread, and as the bread of God, He is of God, He was sent by God, and He was with God—v. 33.
<p class="CC3">6　我们吃了这粮并加以消化，这粮就成为我们的构成，我们也与主联结并调和为一─林前六17。</p>
6.　When we eat this bread and digest it, it becomes our constitution, and we are joined and mingled with the Lord as one— 1 Cor. 6:17.
<p class="CC3">7　人若吃这从天上降下来的活粮，就必永远活着─约六50～51上。</p>
7.　Anyone who eats the living bread which came down out of heaven will live forever—John 6:50-51a.
<p class="CC2">四　在五十一节下半主耶稣说，“我所要赐的粮，就是我的肉，为世人的生命所赐的”：</p>
D.　In verse 51b the Lord Jesus said, "The bread which I will give is My flesh, given for the life of the world":
<p class="CC3">1　到了这里，粮变成了肉。</p>
1.　At this point the bread becomes the flesh.
<p class="CC3">2　主舍了祂的身体，就是祂的肉，为我们死，好叫我们得着生命。</p>
2.　The Lord gave His body, that is, His flesh, dying for us that we might have life.
<p class="CC2">五　“我实实在在地告诉你们，你们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有生命在你们里面”─53节：</p>
E.　"Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless you eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, you do not have life within yourselves"—v. 53:
<p class="CC3">1　血和肉分开是指明死。</p>
1.　The separation of blood and flesh indicates death.
<p class="CC3">2　主在这里清楚指明祂的死，也就是祂的被杀。</p>
2.　Here the Lord clearly indicated His death, that is, His being slain.
<p class="CC3">3　祂为我们舍了身体，流了血，使我们得着永远的生命：</p>
3.　He gave His body and shed His blood for us so that we may have eternal life:
a　吃祂的肉，就是凭信接受祂为我们舍了身体所作成的一切。
a.　To eat His flesh is to receive by faith all that He did in giving His body for us.
b　喝祂的血，就是凭信接受祂为我们流血所完成的一切。
b.　To drink His blood is to receive by faith all that He accomplished in shedding His blood for us.
<p class="CC3">4　这样吃祂的肉喝祂的血，就是借相信祂在十字架上为我们所作成的，好在祂的救赎里，接受祂作生命和生命的供应。</p>
4.　To eat His flesh and drink His blood is to receive Him, in His redemption, as life and the life supply by believing in what He did for us on the cross.
<p class="CC3">5　我们把五十三节与四十七节相比，就能看见，吃主的肉，喝主的血，等于相信祂，因为信或信入，就是接受─一12。</p>
5.　By comparing verse 53 with verse 47, we see that to eat the Lord's flesh and drink His blood is to believe in Him, because to believe or to believe into is to receive—1:12.
<p class="CC2">六　“我的肉是真正的食物，我的血是真正的饮料”─六55：</p>
F.　"My flesh is true food, and My blood is true drink"—6:55:
<p class="CC3">1　我们若不吃人子的肉，不喝人子的血，就没有永远的生命在我们里面。</p>
1.　Unless we eat the flesh of the Son of Man and drink His blood, we do not have eternal life within ourselves.
<p class="CC3">2　我们若吃祂并喝祂，就要因祂得着生命。</p>
2.　If we eat Him and drink Him, we will have life because of Him.
<p class="CC2">七　约翰六章五十七节是整本圣经中最强烈、最奇特的一句话：“活的父怎样差我来，我又因父活着，照样，那吃我的人，也要因我活着”：</p>
G.　The strongest and strangest sentence in the entire Bible is John 6:57: "As the living Father has sent Me and I live because of the Father, so he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me":
<p class="CC3">1　吃就是把食物接受到我们里面，并生机地吸收到我们体内。</p>
1.　To eat is to take food into us that it maybe assimilated organically into our body.
<p class="CC3">2　吃主耶稣就是将祂接受到我们里面，为重生的新人以生命的方式所吸收：</p>
2.　To eat the Lord Jesus is to receive Him into us that He may be assimilated by the regenerated new man in the way of life:
a　然后，我们就凭着所接受的主而活。
a.　Then we live by Him whom we have received.
b　借此，祂这位复活者就活在我们里面─十四19～20。
b.　It is by this that He, the resurrected One, lives in us— 14:19-20.
<p class="CC1">肆　“赐人生命的乃是灵，肉是无益的；我对你们所说的话，就是灵，就是生命”─六63：</p>
IV.　"It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life"— 6:63:
<p class="CC2">一　约翰六章的末了一段论到基督成为赐生命的灵与话。</p>
A.　The last part of John 6 is the section about Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit and the Word.
<p class="CC2">二　因着基督是那灵，我们能在里面接触祂这灵─林前十五45。</p>
B.　Since Christ is the Spirit, we can contact Him as the Spirit within us—1 Cor. 15:45.
<p class="CC2">三　因着祂是赐生命的灵，我们就能从祂得喂养，并吸收祂作为我们的食物。</p>
C.　Because He is the life-giving Spirit, we can feed upon and assimilate Him as our food.
<p class="CC2">四　我们要接受主耶稣作生命的粮，作生命的供应，以滋养我们，就需要看见祂是赐生命的灵，并且这灵具体化在话里─约六63。</p>
D.　In order to receive the Lord Jesus as the bread of life, our life supply to nourish us, we need to see that He is the life-giving Spirit and that this Spirit is embodied in the Word—John 6:63.
<p class="CC2">五　主所赐给我们的，乃是赐人生命的灵；这灵就是复活里的主自己─林前十五45。</p>
E.　What the Lord gives us is the Spirit who gives life; this Spirit is the Lord Himself in resurrection—1 Cor. 15:45.
<p class="CC2">六　在约翰六章六十三节，“话”是在灵之后提到的：─引用经文</p>
F.　In John 6:63 "the words" follow the Spirit:
<p class="CC3">1　主指明为着赐人生命，祂要成为那灵。</p>
1.　The Lord indicated that for giving life He would become the Spirit.
<p class="CC3">2　然后祂说，祂所说的话就是灵，就是生命；这指明祂所说的话，乃是赐生命之灵的具体化─63节。</p>
2.　Then He said that the words He speaks are spirit and life; this indicates that His spoken words are the embodiment of the life-giving Spirit—v. 63.
<p class="CC3">3　我们若没有摸着话中的灵，就无法得着生命。</p>
3.　If we do not touch the Spirit in the Word, we cannot receive life.
<p class="CC3">4　我们天天都需要来到主面前，摸着祂作话中的灵；我们若这么作，就会从基督这生命的粮得喂养─35节。</p>
4.　Daily we need to come to the Lord and touch Him as the Spirit in the Word; if we do this, we will feed on Christ as the bread of life—v. 35.
<p class="CC2">七　约翰六章结束于生命的话，就是我们接受主这生命之粮的凭借─63节：</p>
G.　Chapter 6 of John closes with the word of life, which is the means for us to receive the Lord as the bread of life—v. 63:
<p class="CC3">1　我们接受了话，就有了那灵；我们里面有了那灵，就有基督作内里的生命供应。</p>
1.　If we receive the Word, we will have the Spirit, and if we have the Spirit within us, we will have Christ as the inner supply of life.
<p class="CC3">2　盼望我们都领悟我们需要基督作生命的供应，然后天天接触祂这具体化于话里的赐生命之灵。</p>
2.　May we all realize that our need is Christ as our life supply and then daily contact Him as the life-giving Spirit embodied in the Word.
