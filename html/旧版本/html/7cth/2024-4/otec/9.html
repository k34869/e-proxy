<p class="AA1">第九篇　基督作为复活与麦粒</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">Christ as the Resurrection and the Grain of Wheat</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：约十一25，十二23～24，路十二49～50，林后一8～9，四16，出二五31～40，民十七8</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　我们可以经历、享受并彰显基督作为复活─约十一25：</p>
I.　We can experience, enjoy, and express Christ as the resurrection—John 11:25:
<p class="CC2">一　我们要在复活里生活，就必须看见关于基督复活这个揭示的真理：</p>
A.　In order to live in resurrection, we must see the unveiled truth concerning Christ's resurrection:
<p class="CC3">1　在人性里的基督，在复活里由神生为神的长子─徒十三33，罗八29下。</p>
1.　Christ in His humanity was begotten by God in His resurrection to be the firstborn Son of God—Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29b.
<p class="CC3">2　基督所有的信徒，都是由父神借着基督的复活所重生，为着产生召会作基督的身体，就是祂的复制─彼前一3，约十二24，林前十17。</p>
2.　All the believers of Christ were regenerated by God the Father through the resurrection of Christ for the producing of the church as His Body, His reproduction—1 Pet. 1:3; John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17.
<p class="CC3">3　基督这末后的亚当，成了赐生命的灵─十五45下。</p>
3.　Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit—15:45b.
<p class="CC3">4　没有主复活的这些主要项目（神的长子作身体的头、神的许多儿子作身体的众肢体以及那灵作基督身体的素质和实际），就没有召会，没有基督的身体，也没有神的经纶─参西一18，林前十二12，弗四4。</p>
4.　Without these major items of the Lord's resurrection (the firstborn Son as the Head of the Body, the many sons as the members of the Body, and the Spirit as the essence and reality of the Body), there would be no church, no Body of Christ, and no economy of God—cf. Col. 1:18; 1 Cor. 12:12; Eph. 4:4.
<p class="CC2">二　那灵乃是三一神的实际，复活的实际，基督身体的实际：</p>
B.　The Spirit is the reality of the Triune God, the reality of resurrection, and the reality of the Body of Christ:
<p class="CC3">1　经过过程之三一神的实际，乃是终极完成之实际的灵─约十四17，十五26，十六13，约壹五6。</p>
1.　The reality of the processed Triune God is the consummated Spirit of reality—John 14:17; 15:26; 16:13; 1 John 5:6.
<p class="CC3">2　复活的实际就是基督这赐生命的灵─约十一25，二十22，林前十五45下。</p>
2.　The reality of resurrection is Christ as the life-giving Spirit— John 11:25; 20:22; 1 Cor. 15:45b.
<p class="CC3">3　实际的灵使经过过程之三一神的一切，在基督的身体里成为实际─约十六13～15。</p>
3.　The Spirit of reality makes everything of the processed Triune God a reality in the Body of Christ—John 16:13-15.
<p class="CC3">4　没有那灵，就没有基督的身体，没有召会─弗四4。</p>
4.　Without the Spirit, there is no Body of Christ, no church— Eph. 4:4.
<p class="CC2">三　我们要在基督身体的实际里，就需要完全在基督复活的生命里：</p>
C.　In order to be in the reality of the Body of Christ, we need to be absolutely in the resurrection life of Christ:
<p class="CC3">1　召会完全是出于基督的元素，完全是在复活里，也完全是在诸天界里─彼前一3，弗二6，参创二21～24。</p>
1.　The church is absolutely of the element of Christ, absolutely in resurrection, and absolutely in the heavenlies—1 Pet. 1:3; Eph. 2:6; cf. Gen. 2:21-24.
<p class="CC3">2　金灯台预表召会是基督的身体，描绘基督是复活的生命，要生长、分枝、发苞、开花而发光─出二五31～40，民十七8，启一11～12。</p>
2.　The golden lampstand, typifying the church as the Body of Christ, portrays Christ as the resurrection life, growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light—Exo. 25:31-40; Num. 17:8; Rev. 1:11-12.
<p class="CC2">四　发芽的杖表征基督这位复活者，该是我们的生命、生活和我们里面复活的生命，并且这生命该发芽、开花并结出熟杏─民十七1～11：</p>
D.　The budding rod signifies that Christ, the resurrected One, should be our life, our living, and the resurrection life within us and that this life should bud, blossom, and bear fruit to maturity— Num. 17:1-11:
<p class="CC3">1　在民数记十六章所记载以色列人的背叛之后，神吩咐十二个首领按着以色列十二支派，共取十二根杖，放在见证会幕内的约柜前；然后神说，“我拣选的那人，他的杖必发芽”─十七5。</p>
1.　After the children of Israel rebelled, as recorded in Numbers16, God commanded the twelve leaders to take twelve rods according to the twelve tribes of Israel and put them in the Tent of the Testimony before the Ark; then He said, "The rod of the man whom I choose shall bud"—17:5.
<p class="CC3">2　十二根杖都没有叶子、没有根，都是死枯的；若有哪一根能发芽，哪一根就是神所拣选的；在此我们看见复活乃是神拣选的根据，而事奉的根据乃是在我们天然的生命之外；因此，发芽的杖表征我们经历复活的基督，使我们蒙神悦纳，在神所赐的职事上有权柄。</p>
2.　All twelve rods were leafless, rootless, dry, and dead; whichever one budded was the one chosen by God; here we see that resurrection is the basis of God's selection and that the basis of service is something apart from our natural life; thus, the budding rod signifies our experience of Christ in His resurrection as our acceptance by God for authority in the God-given ministry.
<p class="CC3">3　一切事奉的原则，乃在于发芽的杖；神把其他的十一根杖都发还各首领，只把亚伦那根杖留在约柜里，作永远的记念；这意思是，复活乃是事奉神的永远原则─9～10节。</p>
3.　The principle to every service lies in the budding rod; God returned all the eleven rods to the leaders but kept Aaron's rod inside the Ark as an eternal memorial; this means that resurrection is an eternal principle in our service to God—vv. 9-10.
<p class="CC3">4　枯杖发芽是叫人谦卑的经历；杖指人的地位，发芽指复活的生命；因此，只有愚昧人才会骄傲，才会说他比别人好─参可十一9，林后三5，彼前五5。</p>
4.　The budding of the rod is a humbling experience; a rod signifies human position, whereas budding signifies the resurrection life; thus, only a foolish person would be proud and say that he is better than others—cf. Mark 11:9; 2 Cor. 3:5; 1 Pet. 5:5.
<p class="CC3">5　复活的意思是，一切都是出于神，不是出于我们；复活就是只有神能，我们不能；所有认识复活的人，都是对自己绝望的人；他们知道自己不能。</p>
5.　Resurrection means that everything is of God and not of us; it means that God alone is able and that we are not able; all of those who know resurrection have given up hope in themselves; they know that they cannot make it.
<p class="CC3">6　天然的力量还存在时，复活的能力就无法彰显；撒拉自己会生时，以撒就不能生出来─创十八10～15，二一1～3、6～7。</p>
6.　As long as the natural strength remains, the power of resurrection has no ground for manifestation; as long as Sarah could conceive a child, Isaac would not come—Gen. 18:10-15; 21:1-3, 6-7.
<p class="CC3">7　凡是我们能作的，都是在天然的范围里；我们不能作的，才是在复活的范围里；复活是我们来不及、办不到的─太十九26，可十27，路十八27。</p>
7.　What we can do belongs to the natural realm, and what is impossible for us to do belongs to the realm of resurrection; resurrection speaks of the things that are beyond us, which we cannot do in ourselves—Matt. 19:26; Mark 10:27; Luke 18:27.
<p class="CC3">8　人必须到了尽头，才确知自己一无是处；人如果从未感觉自己不行，就永远无法经历神的行；复活就是说，我们不行，一切乃是神在我们里面、借着我们并为我们作的─参林后一8～9，四7。</p>
8.　A man must come to the end of himself before he will be convinced of his utter uselessness; if a man has never realized his own inability, he can never experience God's ability; resurrection means that we cannot make it and that God is the One who does everything in us, through us, and for us—cf. 2 Cor. 1:8-9; 4:7.
<p class="CC3">9　作基督徒不仅困难，而且不可能；唯有那经过过程并终极完成，作为包罗万有之灵的三一神活在我们里面，这一位才能作基督徒；唯有那灵能作基督徒，并且唯有那灵能作得胜者。</p>
9.　To be a Christian is not merely difficult—it is impossible; only the processed and consummated Triune God living in us as the all-inclusive Spirit can be a Christian; only the Spirit can be a Christian, and only the Spirit can be an overcomer.
<p class="CC2">五　当我们不凭我们天然的生命，乃凭我们里面神圣的生命而活时，我们就在复活里，其结果就是基督的身体─腓三10～11：</p>
E.　When we do not live by our natural life but live by the divine life within us, we are in resurrection; the issue of this is the Body of Christ—Phil. 3:10-11:
<p class="CC3">1　我们都需要受主的训练作门徒，成为神圣且奥秘的人，否认我们天然的生命，而活神圣的生命─参约三8。</p>
1.　We all need to be discipled by the Lord to be divine and mystical persons, living the divine life by denying our natural life—cf. John 3:8.
<p class="CC3">2　任何事，即使是按照圣经却在天然生命里作的，都不是基督身体的实际─林前三12。</p>
2.　Anything that is carried out even scripturally but in the natural life is not the reality of the Body of Christ—1 Cor. 3:12.
<p class="CC2">六　我们要在复活里生活，就必须认识、经历并得着复活的神─林后一8～9：</p>
F.　In order to live in resurrection, we must know, experience, and gain the God of resurrection—2 Cor. 1:8-9:
<p class="CC3">1　神一直借着十字架作工，以了结我们，领我们到尽头，使我们不再信靠自己，只信靠复活的神─9节。</p>
1.　God is working through the cross to terminate us, to bring us to an end, so that we will no longer trust in ourselves but in the God of resurrection—v. 9.
<p class="CC3">2　虽然活的神能为人作许多事，活神的生命和性情却没有作到人里面；当复活的神作工时，祂的生命和性情就作到人里面：</p>
2.　Although the living God can perform many acts on man's behalf, the life and nature of the living God are not wrought into man; when the God of resurrection works, His life and nature are wrought into man:
<p class="CC4">a　神作工不是以外面的作为使人认识祂的权能，祂作工乃是将祂自己分赐并作到人里面─加一15～16，二20，四19。</p>
a.　God is not working to make His might known in external acts but is working to impart and work Himself into man— Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20; 4:19.
<p class="CC4">b　神使用环境，好将祂的生命和性情作到我们里面─林后四7～12，帖前三3。</p>
b.　God uses the environment in order to work His life and nature into us—2 Cor. 4:7-12; 1 Thes. 3:3.
<p class="CC4">c　我们要在复活里生活并被复活的神所构成，就必须借着“万有”，被模成神长子基督的形像─罗八28～29，来十二10，耶四八11。</p>
c.　In order to live in resurrection and be constituted with the God of resurrection, we must be conformed to the image of Christ as the firstborn Son of God through "all things"— Rom. 8:28-29; Heb. 12:10; Jer. 48:11.
<p class="CC4">d　这宇宙中的苦难，特别是对于神的儿女，其主要的目的乃是借着苦难，让神的性情得以作到人的性情里，使人能得着神，达到极完满的地步。</p>
d.　The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God may be wrought into the nature of man so that man may gain God to the fullest extent.
<p class="CC4">e　当我们经过患难时，在我们里面天天需要有不断的更新，好使神能完成祂心头的愿望，将我们作成新耶路撒冷─结三六26，林后四16，五17，启二一2。</p>
e.　As we pass through afflictions, there needs to be a continual renewing taking place in us day by day so that God can accomplish His heart's desire to make us the New Jerusalem—Ezek. 36:26; 2 Cor. 4:16; 5:17; Rev. 21:2.
<p class="CC3">3　我们要在复活里生活，就必须因复活生命新鲜的供应得着滋养，而日日得更新─林后四16。</p>
3.　In order to live in resurrection, we must be renewed day by day by being nourished with the fresh supply of the resurrection life—2 Cor. 4:16.
<p class="CC3">4　真实的基督徒生活乃是在早晨、在晚上，天天都有复活的神加到我们里面─西二19，罗八10、6、11。</p>
4.　The real Christian life is to have the God of resurrection added into us morning and evening and day by day—Col. 2:19; Rom. 8:10, 6, 11.
<p class="CC3">5　我们要得着在复活里神圣生命更新的性能，就需要接触神，将自己向祂敞开，让祂进到我们里面，成为我们里面逐日新鲜的加增─腓二12～13，三10～11，诗十八标题，林后四10～12、16，多三5，弗四23，五26。</p>
5.　In order to receive the renewing capacity of the divine life in resurrection, we need to contact God, open ourselves up to Him, and let Him come into us to be a new addition in us day by day—Phil. 2:12-13; 3:10-11; Psa. 18 title; 2 Cor. 4:10-12, 16; Titus 3:5; Eph. 4:23; 5:26.
<p class="CC1">贰　我们可以经历、享受并彰显基督作为麦粒─约十二24：</p>
II.　We can experience, enjoy, and express Christ as the grain of wheat—John 12:24:
<p class="CC2">一　基督神性的荣耀连同祂神圣的生命，原遮藏在祂里面，如同藏在一粒麦子内─23～24节。</p>
A.　The glory of Christ's divinity with His divine life was concealed in Him as in a grain of wheat—vv. 23-24.
<p class="CC2">二　当祂神性的荣耀被祂人性的外壳遮藏时，祂受困迫和拘禁，渴望受死的浸，使祂神性的荣耀连同祂神圣生命的火，得以释放出来─路十二49～50。</p>
B.　While the glory of His divinity was concealed by the shell of His humanity, He was pressed and constrained, longing to be baptized with the baptism of His death for the release of the glory of His divinity with the fire of His divine life—Luke 12:49-50.
<p class="CC2">三　基督神性的荣耀，乃是借着祂的死使祂人性的外壳破裂，而得以释放出来─约十二24：</p>
C.　The release of the glory of Christ's divinity was through the breaking of the shell of His humanity by His death—John 12:24:
<p class="CC3">1　祂是那独一的麦粒，含有神圣的生命连同神圣的荣耀。</p>
1.　He was the unique grain that contained His divine life with His divine glory.
<p class="CC3">2　当祂人性的外壳借着祂的钉十字架而破裂时，祂神性的一切元素─祂神圣的生命和神圣的荣耀─就都释放出来。</p>
2.　When the shell of His humanity was broken through His crucifixion, all the elements of His divinity—His divine life and His divine glory—were released.
<p class="CC3">3　就这一面的意义说，祂的死可以看作是释放生命的死，同时也释放祂的荣耀。</p>
3.　In this sense, His death is considered a life-releasing death with His glory released simultaneously.
<p class="CC2">四　基督神性之荣耀的释放，乃是祂经过死而在复活里，为父用神圣的荣耀所荣耀─23～24节，路二四26。</p>
D.　The release of the glory of Christ's divinity was His being glorified by the Father with the divine glory in His resurrection through His death—vv. 23-24; Luke 24:26.
<p class="CC2">五　基督在祂的人性生活里祷告，求父荣耀祂，父也答应了祂的祷告─约十七1，徒三13。</p>
E.　Christ in His human living prayed that His Father would glorify Him, and the Father answered His prayer—John 17:1; Acts 3:13.
<p class="CC2">六　这样的得荣耀，把基督从成肉体的时期迁入总括的时期，在其中，祂这位末后的亚当在复活里成了赐生命的灵。</p>
F.　Such a glorification transferred Christ from the stage of incarnation into the stage of inclusion, in which He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
<p class="CC2">七　基督作为麦粒借着祂释放生命的死与分赐生命的复活，将祂所有的信徒都带进与经过过程之三一神的合并里：</p>
G.　Through His life-releasing death and life-dispensing resurrection as the grain of wheat, Christ brought all His believers into an incorporation with the processed Triune God:
<p class="CC3">1　神在祂神圣的三一里，乃是一个合并─约十四10～11。</p>
1.　God in His Divine Trinity is an incorporation—John 14:10-11.
<p class="CC3">2　终极完成的三一神与重生的信徒，在基督的复活里成为一个合并─16～20节。</p>
2.　The consummated Triune God and the regenerated believers became an incorporation in the resurrection of Christ— vv.16-20.
<p class="CC2">八　在基督的复活里，经过过程的三一神与重生的信徒那扩大、神人二性、宇宙的合并，是由基督作为变化形像的麦粒所产生的，有三方面：</p>
H.　In the resurrection of Christ, the enlarged, divine-human, universal incorporation of the processed Triune God with the regenerated believers came forth from Christ as the transfigured grain of wheat in three aspects:
<p class="CC3">1　第一方面乃是父的家，使祂得着安息、满足和显现─2节：</p>
1.　The first aspect is the Father's house for His rest, satisfaction, and manifestation—v. 2:
<p class="CC4">a　所有在基督里的信徒，都是父家里的住处─2节上。</p>
a.　All the believers in Christ are the abodes in the Father's house—v. 2a.
<p class="CC4">b　这父的家乃是借着父和子同着那灵，不断地眷临蒙救赎的选民而得以建造起来─21、23节，弗二19～22，三16～19。</p>
b.　The Father's house is built up by the constant visitation to the redeemed elect of the Father and the Son with the Spirit—vv. 21, 23; Eph. 2:19-22; 3:16-19.
<p class="CC3">2　第二方面乃是真葡萄树，使神得着扩大、扩展和荣耀─约十五1～8、16：</p>
2.　The second aspect is the true vine for God's enlargement, spreading, and glorification—John 15:1-8, 16:
<p class="CC4">a　真葡萄树作包罗万有之基督的表号，乃是经过过程并终极完成之三一神的生机体。</p>
a.　The true vine, as a sign of the all-inclusive Christ, is the organism of the processed and consummated Triune God.
<p class="CC4">b　其接上的枝子已得着重生而有了神圣的生命，被带进与钉死并复活之基督的生命联结里，且与经过过程并终极完成的三一神合并一起。</p>
b.　Its grafted branches have been regenerated with the divine life, brought into the life union with the crucified and resurrected Christ, and incorporated with the processed and consummated Triune God.
<p class="CC3">3　第三方面乃是那灵的孩子，新人，以完成神永远的经纶─十六13～16、19～22：</p>
3.　The third aspect is the child of the Spirit, the new man, to carry out God's eternal economy—16:13-16, 19-22:
<p class="CC4">a　新孩子，新人，乃是由终极完成的那灵所生─弗二15。</p>
a.　A new child, a new man, was born by the consummated Spirit—Eph. 2:15.
<p class="CC4">b　我们借着在心思的灵里得着更新而穿上这新人，至终就要终极完成基督的身体；这基督的身体要终极完成新耶路撒冷─四23～24。</p>
b.　Our putting on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of our mind will eventually consummate the Body of Christ, which will consummate the New Jerusalem—4:23-24.
