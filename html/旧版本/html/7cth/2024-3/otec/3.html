<p class="AA1">第三篇　作为圣膏油之复合膏油的内在意义与启示─经过过程之三一神的复合、包罗万有之灵完满的预表</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">The Intrinsic Significance and Revelation of the Compound Ointment as the Holy Anointing Oil— a Full Type of the Compound, All-inclusive Spirit of the Processed Triune God</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：出三十22~30，林前十五45下，约七37~39，腓一19</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　圣膏油，就是橄榄油与四种香料“按调制香品者之法”复合成的膏油，乃是耶稣基督之灵完满的预表，这灵就是基督借着死与复活成了那经过过程的三一神复合、包罗万有、赐生命的灵─出三十22~25，林前十五45下，约七37~39，腓一19：</p>
<p class="CC2">I.　The holy anointing oil, a compound ointment of olive oil and four spices, "compounded according to the work of a compounder," is a full type of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God, whom Christ became through His death and resurrection—Exo. 30:22-25; 1 Cor. 15:45b; John 7:37-39; Phil. 1:19:</p>
<p class="CC2">一　这复合膏油的成分意义如下：</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　The significances of the ingredients of this compound anointing oil are as follows:</p>
<p class="CC3">1　流质的没药是埋葬时所用的香料（约十九39），表征基督宝贵的死（罗六3）：─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Flowing myrrh, a spice used in burial (John 19:39), signifies the precious death of Christ (Rom. 6:3):</p>
<p class="CC4">a　没药也用作止痛剂，以减轻死亡的痛苦；主耶稣被钉十字架时，有人拿没药调和的酒给祂，要减轻祂的痛苦─可十五23。</p>
<p class="CC4">a.　Myrrh was also used as a painkiller to reduce the suffering of death; when the Lord Jesus was being crucified, He was offered wine mixed with myrrh to reduce His pain—Mark 15:23.</p>
<p class="CC4">b　没药也能用来治好身体不当的分泌；在我们的人生中，有许多不当的分泌物，但主在十字架上的死治好了这个难处。</p>
<p class="CC4">b.　Myrrh can also be used for healing the body when it gives off the wrong kind of secretion; in our human life there are many wrong secretions, but the Lord's death on the cross corrects this problem.</p>
<p class="CC3">2　香肉桂表征基督之死的甜美与功效─罗八13：</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Fragrant cinnamon signifies the sweetness and effectiveness of Christ's death—Rom. 8:13:</p>
<p class="CC4">a　肉桂可以用为增强衰弱心脏的处方。</p>
<p class="CC4">a.　Cinnamon was prescribed to stimulate a weak heart.</p>
<p class="CC4">b　当我们将在那灵里之主的死，应用到我们内里的所是里，我们的心就会被增强，使我们在主里快乐欢喜─腓四4，尼八10。</p>
<p class="CC4">b.　When we apply the Lord's death in the Spirit to our inner being, our heart is stimulated to make us happy and joyful in the Lord—Phil. 4:4; Neh. 8:10.</p>
<p class="CC3">3　香菖蒲，出自一种在沼泽或泥泞之处往上生长的芦苇，表征基督宝贵的复活─弗二6，西三1，彼前一3。</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　Fragrant calamus, from a reed that grew upward in a marsh or muddy place, signifies the precious resurrection of Christ—Eph. 2:6; Col. 3:1; 1 Pet. 1:3.</p>
<p class="CC3">4　桂皮，古时用以驱逐蛇虫，表征基督复活的驱逐大能；桂皮驱逐一切邪恶的“昆虫”，特别是古蛇魔鬼─腓三10。</p>
<p class="CC4">4.　Cassia, used in ancient times to repel insects and snakes, signifies the repelling power of Christ's resurrection; cassia repels all the evil "insects" and especially the old serpent, the devil—Phil. 3:10.</p>
<p class="CC3">5　橄榄油作为复合膏油的基本成分，表征神的灵是复合之灵的基础─创一2。</p>
<p class="CC4">5.　Olive oil as the base of the compound ointment signifies the Spirit of God as the base of the compound Spirit—Gen. 1:2.</p>
<p class="CC2">二　四这数字表征以人为首（26）的受造之物（结一5），一这数字表征独一的神（申四35，提前二5），所以，四种香料表征在神创造里基督的人性，一欣橄榄油表征独一的神带着祂的神性；因此，橄榄油与四种香料相调，表征在复合的灵里，神与人，神性与人性的复合、调和─利二4与注2。</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　Since the number four signifies the creatures (Ezek. 1:5), of which man is the head (Gen. 1:26), and the number one signifies the unique God (Deut. 4:35; 1 Tim. 2:5), the four spices signify the humanity of Christ in God's creation, and the one hin of olive oil signifies the unique God with His divinity; thus, the blending of olive oil with the four spices signifies the compounding, the mingling, of God and man, of divinity and humanity, in the compound Spirit—Lev. 2:4 and footnote 3.</p>
<p class="CC2">三　预备橄榄油和四种香料，都必须经过压榨或切割的过程，表征神的灵借着基督的受苦（太二六36）成了基督的灵（罗八9）。─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　The olive oil and the four spices were all prepared through a process of either pressing or cutting, signifying that the Spirit of God became the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9) through Christ's sufferings (Matt. 26:36).</p>
<p class="CC2">四　不仅如此，四种香料的份量有三个完整的五百舍客勒单位，中间的五百舍客勒分开为两半，表征在复活里的三一神，第二者（子）借着在十字架上的死“分开了”。</p>
<p class="CC3">D.　Furthermore, the measure of the four spices, being three complete units of five hundred shekels each, the middle five hundred shekels being split into two parts, signifies the Triune God in resurrection, the second, the Son, being "split" by His death on the cross.</p>
<p class="CC2">五　在圣经里，五是负责任的数字（太二五2与注1），因此，复合膏油的五种元素以及四种香料的三个五百舍客勒单位，表征三一神在复活里作为大能、能力，为着担负责任。─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">E.　Since in the Bible five is the number for responsibility (25:2 and footnote 1), the five elements in the compound ointment and the three units of five hundred shekels of the four spices signify the Triune God in resurrection as the power, the capability, for bearing responsibility.</p>
<p class="CC2">六　三和五这两个数字与神的建造有关（看创六15注2），所以复合膏油中这两个数字，表征复合的灵里有神建造的元素。─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">F.　Since the numbers three and five are related to God's building (see footnote 152 in Gen. 6), these numbers in the compound ointment signify that in the compound Spirit there is the element for God's building.</p>
<p class="CC2">七　基于前述意义，四种香料与橄榄油复合成一种膏油，表征借着基督的成为肉体、人性生活、钉十字架、复活和升天等过程，上述元素就与神的灵调和，产生复合的灵，为着建造神永远的居所。</p>
<p class="CC3">G.　Based on the above significances, the compounding of the four spices with the olive oil to make an anointing oil signifies the mingling of the above-mentioned elements with the Spirit of God through the process of Christ's incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to produce the compound Spirit for the building of God's eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p class="CC1">贰　复合的膏油，就是圣膏油，用以膏抹帐幕及其一切器物、祭坛和坛的一切器具、洗濯盆和盆座以及祭司，使这一切成为圣别，分别为圣归与神，为着祂神圣的定旨─出三十26~30，彼前一2，林前六11，罗十五16：</p>
<p class="CC2">II.　The compound ointment, the holy anointing oil, was used to anoint the tabernacle with all its furniture, the altar with all its utensils, the laver and its base, and the priests, to make all these things holy, separated, sanctified, to God for His divine purpose—Exo. 30:26-30; 1 Pet. 1:2; 1 Cor. 6:11; Rom. 15:16:</p>
<p class="CC2">一　这膏油表征三一神借着基督的成为肉体、钉死与复活，经过过程并终极完成为包罗万有复合的灵，临到蒙祂拣选并救赎的人，以祂自己膏抹他们，使祂自己与他们成为一，并使他们与祂成为一─约二十22，约壹二20、27，林后一21，林前六17。</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　This ointment signifies the Triune God processed and consummated through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection to become the all-inclusive compound Spirit to reach His chosen and redeemed people and to anoint them with Himself, making Himself one with them and making them one with Him—John 20:22; 1 John 2:20, 27; 2 Cor. 1:21; 1 Cor. 6:17.</p>
<p class="CC2">二　这样的膏抹既是复合的灵在我们里面的运行，就实施在我们身上，且将经过过程并终极完成之三一神的一切成分，加到我们里面的所是里，使我们里面的人，凭神圣的元素在神圣的生命里得以长大，并使我们与神调和为一─西二19。</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　Such an anointing, being the moving of the compound Spirit within us, applies to us and also adds all the elements of the processed and consummated Triune God into our inner being so that our inner man may grow in the divine life with the divine elements and we may be mingled with God as one—Col. 2:19.</p>
<p class="CC2">三　圣膏油仅仅为着一个目的，就是膏抹神的居所和祭司体系（参彼前二5）；因此，唯有为着神的居所和祭司体系的人，才能享受复合、包罗万有的灵。─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　The holy anointing oil is solely for the purpose of anointing God's dwelling place and the priesthood (cf. 1 Pet. 2:5); hence, only those who are for God's dwelling place and for the priesthood can have the enjoyment of the compound, all-inclusive Spirit.</p>
<p class="CC1">叁　橄榄油所表征神的灵不再仅仅是油，如今它乃是复合着一些成分的油；关于这点，约翰七章三十九节说，“耶稣这话是指着信入祂的人将要受的那灵说的；那时还没有那灵，因为耶稣尚未得着荣耀”：</p>
<p class="CC2">III.　The Spirit of God, signified by olive oil, is no longer merely oil, but now it is oil com-pounded with certain ingredients; regarding this, John 7:39 says, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified":</p>
<p class="CC2">一　这意思是，主得着荣耀（就是祂的复活─路二四26）以前，还没有复合的灵；乃是基督复活以后，这灵的复合或调和，才得以完成。─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　This means that before the Lord's glorification, which was His resurrection (Luke 24:26), the compound Spirit was not yet; it was after Christ's resurrection that the compounding, or the blending, of such a Spirit was completed.</p>
<p class="CC2">二　当这灵还是神的灵，祂只有神圣的元素；当祂借着基督的成为肉体、钉十字架并复活，成了耶稣基督的灵之后，祂就兼有神圣与属人的元素，连同基督成为肉体、钉十字架和复活的一切素质和实际。</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element; after He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.</p>
<p class="CC2">三　这圣膏油所预表之包罗万有复合的灵，乃是耶稣基督之灵全备的供应，就是基督身体的供应，借此我们能在身体里、借着身体并为着身体活基督，以显大基督─腓一19~21上。</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　This all-inclusive compound Spirit, typified by the holy anointing oil, is the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the supply of the Body of Christ, by which we can live Christ for His magnification in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body—Phil. 1:19-21a.</p>
<p class="CC1">肆　我们这些信徒都已经被复合的膏油，就是包罗万有的灵所膏抹；诗篇一百三十三篇二节描述膏油如何从亚伦的头上流到胡须，又流到他的衣襟；这表征整个基督的身体都被那灵所膏抹：─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC2">IV.　As believers, we have been anointed with the compound ointment, with the all-inclusive Spirit; Psalm 133:2 describes how the anointing oil flowed down from Aaron's head to his beard and then to the hem of his garments; this signifies that the whole Body is anointed with the Spirit:</p>
<p class="CC2">一　一的立场就是经过过程的三一神作为圣膏油，复合的灵，应用到我们身上─1~3节。</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　The ground of oneness is simply the processed Triune God as the holy anointing oil, the compound Spirit, applied to our being—vv. 1-3.</p>
<p class="CC2">二　我们要被膏油所“油漆”（约壹二20、27），就必须与召会是一；这样，我们自然就享受到膏油和其中各种成分的涂抹；取用这膏油所产生的一，是何等的奇妙！─引用经文</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　In order to be "painted" by the ointment (1 John 2:20, 27), we must be one with the church; then we will spontaneously enjoy the application of the anointing oil with all its elements; how marvelous is the oneness produced by the application of this ointment!</p>
