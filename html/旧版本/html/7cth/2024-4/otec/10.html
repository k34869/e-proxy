F.　In chapter 17 Jesus said, "Father,…glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You" (v. 1); "Now, glorify Me along with Yourself, Father, with the glory which I had with You before the world was" (v. 5):
<p class="CC3">1　这是主在约翰十七章祷告的主题。</p>

<p class="CC3">2　主在这个祷告之先，曾预言祂要得荣耀，父也要在祂身上得荣耀─十二23，十三31～32。</p>
2.　Before this prayer the Lord Jesus predicted that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him— 12:23; 13:31-32.
<p class="CC3">3　基督要复活，将祂的人性提高到神圣的元素里，并使祂神圣的元素得着彰显，以致祂的全人，包括神性和人性，都得着荣耀；这样，父也在子身上得着荣耀。</p>
3.　Christ would resurrect that He might uplift His humanity into the divine element and that His divine element might be expressed, with the result that His entire being, His divinity and His humanity, would be glorified; thus the Father would be glorified in the Son.
<p class="CC2">七　主耶稣祷告，愿我们进入一的最高阶段─在神圣荣耀里的一，使三一神得着团体的彰显：“你所赐给我的荣耀，我已赐给他们，使他们成为一，正如我们是一一样”─十七22：</p>
G.　The Lord Jesus prayed that we would enter into the highest stage of oneness—the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of the Triune God: "The glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one"—17:22:
<p class="CC3">1　这是信徒最深的一；这个一是在神圣的荣耀里，为着神团体的彰显。</p>
1.　This is the believers' deepest oneness, the oneness in the divine glory for the corporate expression of God.
<p class="CC3">2　在这个一的这面，信徒已完全否认己，享受父的荣耀作他们那个被成全之一的要素，得被建造而团体地彰显神。</p>
2.　In this aspect of oneness the believers, their self having been fully denied, enjoy the glory of the Father as the factor of their perfected oneness and thus express God in a corporate, built-up way.

<p class="CC2">一　得荣耀的意思就是显明；得荣就是得着显明。</p>
A.　Glorification means manifestation; to be glorified is to be manifested.
<p class="CC2">二　主在约翰十四至十六章信息的要点，就是子要得荣耀，好使父在子身上得荣耀：</p>
B.　The main point of the Lord's message in John 14 through 16 is that the Son may be glorified so that the Father may be glorified in the Son:
<p class="CC3">1　主在信息中说到得荣耀，祂在祷告中也为得荣耀祷告─十三31～32，十四13，十五8，十七1、5。</p>
1.　In His message the Lord spoke of glorification, and in His prayer He prayed for glorification—13:31-32; 14:13; 15:8; 17:1, 5.
<p class="CC3">2　基督乃是在复活里，为父用神圣的荣耀所荣耀─七39：</p>
2.　Christ was glorified by the Father with the divine glory in His resurrection—7:39:
<p class="CC4">a　“得着荣耀”是指“复活”，因为主是在复活时得着荣耀；祂的复活把祂带进荣耀里─路二四26，林前十五43，徒三13、15。</p>
a.　Glorified stands for resurrected, for the Lord was glorified when He was resurrected; His resurrection brought Him into glory—Luke 24:26; 1 Cor. 15:43; Acts 3:13, 15.
<p class="CC4">b　按照新约的思想，复活乃是生命的释放，这种生命的释放就是得荣耀；所以，“得荣耀”与“复活”乃是同义辞。</p>
b.　According to the New Testament thought, resurrection is a release in life, and this release in life is a matter of glorification; glorification is therefore a synonym of resurrection.
<p class="CC2">三　今天，子乃是借着召会得着荣耀，使父在子里面，并借着子得着荣耀─约十七22，弗三21：</p>
C.　Today it is by the church that the Son will be glorified so that the Father might be glorified in and through the Son—John 17:22; Eph. 3:21:
<p class="CC3">1　荣耀是神圣生命和神圣性情的彰显；我们越凭神圣生命和神圣性情活着，召会中就越有神圣的荣耀─约十七22，弗三21。</p>
1.　Glory is the expression of the divine life and the divine nature; the more we live by the divine life and the divine nature, the more divine glory there will be in the church—John 17:22; Eph. 3:21.
<p class="CC3">2　借着基督的信徒在那奇妙、互相内在的一里，在子里与父有生机的联结，父就得着荣耀─约十七23：</p>
2.　The Father is glorified through the organic union of Christ's believers with the Father in the Son in a wonderful coinhering oneness—John 17:23:
<p class="CC4">a　当我们是一时，基督就得着荣耀，父也得着荣耀。</p>
a.　When we are one, Christ is glorified, and the Father also is glorified.
<p class="CC4">b　约翰十七章的一，乃是为着父在子里得荣耀；这个一实际上就是神圣的得荣。</p>
b.　The oneness in John 17 is for the Father's glorification in the Son; this oneness is actually the divine glorification.
<p class="CC3">3　在神圣的得荣里，三一神在人性里得着荣耀，而人性也在神性里得着荣耀─启二一10～11。</p>
3.　In the divine glorification the Triune God is glorified in humanity, and humanity is glorified in divinity—Rev. 21:10-11.
