<p class="AA1">第十二篇　神圣的三一、耶稣的灵与神的国</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">The Divine Trinity, the Spirit of Jesus, and the Kingdom of God</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：徒一3，二32～36，八12，十四22，十六6～7，二十28，二八23、31</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　神圣的三一乃是整本新约的架构；照样，神圣的三一也是使徒行传的结构；一章又一章，使徒行传揭示出神圣三一为着执行神新约经纶而有的运行─例如一1～2、4～5、8、11、21，二4、17～18、21～24、27、31～33、36、38，十三2、4、7、9～10、12、16、23、30、33～39、49～50、52，二八15、23、25、31：</p>
I.　Even as the Divine Trinity is the framework of the entire New Testament, so the Divine Trinity is the structure of the book of Acts; chapter after chapter of Acts unveils the operation of the Divine Trinity for the carrying out of God's New Testament economy—e.g., 1:1-2, 4-5, 8, 11, 21; 2:4, 17-18, 21-24, 27, 31-33, 36, 38; 13:2, 4, 7, 9-10, 12, 16, 23, 30, 33-39, 49-50, 52; 28:15, 23, 25, 31:
<p class="CC2">一　三一神─父、子、灵─完全包含在子的升天和那灵的浇灌里─二32～36：</p>
A.　The Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Spirit—was fully involved with the Son's ascension and the pouring out of the Spirit—2:32-36:
<p class="CC3">1　子升天，父高举祂，那灵浇灌下来─路二四51，腓二9，徒一9～11，二32～36。</p>
1.　The Son ascended, the Father exalted Him, and the Spirit was poured out—Luke 24:51; Phil. 2:9; Acts 1:9-11; 2:32-36.
<p class="CC3">2　父、子、灵都紧密地联于那灵的浇灌，那灵乃是经过过程之三一神的终极完成─33节，约七37～39，腓一19。</p>
2.　The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were all wrapped up with the outpouring of the Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God—v.33; John 7:37-39; Phil. 1:19.
<p class="CC2">二　在行传十六章六至七节，“圣灵”与“耶稣的灵”交互使用，启示耶稣的灵就是圣灵：─引用经文</p>
B.　In Acts 16:6-7 the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus are used interchangeably, revealing that the Spirit of Jesus is the Holy Spirit:
<p class="CC3">1　在新约里，“圣灵”是神的灵一般的称呼─徒九17、31。</p>
1.　The Holy Spirit is a general title of the Spirit of God in the New Testament—Acts 9:17, 31.
<p class="CC3">2　保罗作为盛装三一神的器皿，完全是由圣灵与耶稣的灵所构成─弗三14～17，路一35，徒二32～36，腓一19。</p>
2.　As a vessel containing the Triune God, Paul was fully constituted of the Holy Spirit and of the Spirit of Jesus—Eph. 3:14-17; Luke 1:35; Acts 2:32-36; Phil. 1:19.
<p class="CC3">3　我们为主作哪一种工，在于我们由哪一种灵所引导、指引、教导并构成；当包罗万有的灵成了我们的构成，我们的工作就要成为这灵的彰显─徒十六6～7，罗八9，腓一19。</p>
3.　The kind of work that we do for the Lord depends on the kind of Spirit by whom we are guided, directed, instructed, and constituted; when the all-inclusive Spirit becomes our constitution, our work will be the expression of this Spirit—Acts 16:6-7; Rom. 8:9; Phil. 1:19.
<p class="CC2">三　神“用自己的血”买了召会─徒二十28：</p>
C.　God obtained the church "through His own blood"—Acts 20:28:
<p class="CC3">1　神付了祂“自己的血”为代价，将召会买来。</p>
1.　God purchased the church by paying the price of "His own blood."
<p class="CC3">2　借着成为肉体，我们的神，创造主，那永远者，就与人调和─约一1、14：</p>
2.　Through incarnation our God, the Creator, the eternal One, became mingled with man—John 1:1, 14:
<p class="CC4">a　结果，祂不再仅仅是神─祂成了神人，有血并且能为我们死─约壹一7。</p>
a.　As a result, He was no longer only God—He became a God-man, who had blood and was able to die for us—1 John 1:7.
<p class="CC4">b　当神人主耶稣死在十字架上时，祂不仅作为人受死，也作为神受死。</p>
b.　When the Lord Jesus, the God-man, died on the cross, He died not only as man but also as God.
<p class="CC3">3　祂所流的血，不仅是那人耶稣的血，也是神人的血。</p>
3.　The blood that He shed was not only the blood of the man Jesus but also the blood of the God-man.
<p class="CC3">4　因此，神用以将召会买来的这血，乃是祂“自己的血”─徒二十28。</p>
4.　Therefore, His blood, through which God obtained the church, is "His own blood"—Acts 20:28.
<p class="CC1">贰　“耶稣的灵”是神的灵特别的说法，指成为肉体之救主的灵，这位救主就是在人性里的耶稣，经过了为人的生活和十字架上的死─十六7：</p>
II.　The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression concerning the Spirit of God and refers to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior who, as Jesus in His humanity, passed through human living and death on the cross—16:7:
<p class="CC2">一　在耶稣的灵里不仅有神的神圣元素，也有耶稣的人性元素，以及祂为人生活并受死的元素─一3。</p>
A.　In the Spirit of Jesus there is not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus and the elements of His human living and His suffering of death as well—1:3.
<p class="CC2">二　耶稣的灵不只是神的灵，在祂里面有神性，使我们能活神圣的生命；也是那人耶稣的灵，在祂里面有人性，使我们能过正确的人性生活，也能忍受其中的痛苦─罗八18，林后一5：</p>
B.　The Spirit of Jesus is not only the Spirit of God with divinity in Him so that we may live the divine life but also the Spirit of the man Jesus with humanity in Him so that we may live a proper human life and endure its sufferings—Rom. 8:18; 2 Cor. 1:5:
<p class="CC3">1　保罗在他的受苦里需要耶稣的灵，因为在耶稣的灵里，有受苦的元素和忍受逼迫的能力─西一24，徒九15～16，十六7。</p>
1.　In his suffering Paul needed the Spirit of Jesus because in the Spirit of Jesus there is the suffering element and the suffering strength to with stand persecution—Col. 1:24; Acts 9:15-16; 16:7.
<p class="CC3">2　今天当我们传福音时，我们也需要耶稣的灵以面对反对和逼迫。</p>
2.　In our preaching of the gospel today, we also need the Spirit of Jesus to face the opposition and persecution.
<p class="CC2">三　耶稣的灵所涵括的比圣灵所涵括的更多─6～7节：</p>
C.　The Spirit of Jesus involves more than the Holy Spirit—vv. 6-7:
<p class="CC3">1　圣灵仅仅涵括主耶稣的成为肉体和出生─路一35，太一18、20。</p>
1.　The Holy Spirit involves only the incarnation and birth of the Lord Jesus—Luke 1:35; Matt. 1:18, 20.
<p class="CC3">2　耶稣的灵涵括祂的人性、为人生活、包罗万有的死、分赐生命的复活以及升天─徒一1～3、8，二23、32、36。</p>
2.　The Spirit of Jesus involves His humanity, human living, all- inclusive death, life-imparting resurrection, and ascension— Acts 1:1-3, 8; 2:23, 32, 36.
<p class="CC2">四　正如基督的灵是基督的实际，耶稣的灵乃是耶稣的实际─罗八9，徒十六7：</p>
D.　Just as the Spirit of Christ is the reality of Christ, so the Spirit of Jesus is the reality of Jesus—Rom. 8:9; Acts 16:7:
<p class="CC3">1　我们若没有耶稣的灵，耶稣对我们就不真实。</p>
1.　If we do not have the Spirit of Jesus, Jesus will not be real to us.
<p class="CC3">2　耶稣对我们是真实的，因为我们有耶稣的灵作耶稣的实际、实化─7节。</p>
2.　Jesus is real to us because we have the Spirit of Jesus as the reality, the realization, of Jesus—v. 7.
<p class="CC1">叁　神的国乃是使徒行传中使徒们传讲的主题─一3，八12，十四22，十九8，二十25，二八23、31：</p>
III.　The kingdom of God is the main subject of the apostles' preaching in Acts—1:3; 8:12; 14:22; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31:
<p class="CC2">一　复活的基督有四十天之久，向使徒们显现，对他们讲说“神国的事”，这指明神的国乃是使徒们在五旬节后的使命中，所要传讲的主题─一3。</p>
A.　The fact that the resurrected Christ, in His appearing to the apostles through a period of forty days, spoke to them "the things concerning the kingdom of God" indicates that the kingdom would be the main subject of the apostles' preaching in their coming commission after Pentecost—1:3.
<p class="CC2">二　按照新约，神的国不是眼所能见物质的范围；实际上，神的国乃是一个人位，就是主耶稣基督自己─路十七20～21。</p>
B.　According to the New Testament, the kingdom of God is not a visible, material realm; actually, the kingdom of God is a person, the Lord Jesus Christ Himself—Luke 17:20-21.
<p class="CC2">三　众召会与神的国是并行的；由复活基督的繁殖所产生的众召会，乃是今天在地上神的国─徒十四22，二十25：</p>
C.　The churches and the kingdom of God go together; the churches produced by the propagation of the resurrected Christ are the kingdom of God on earth today—Acts 14:22; 20:25:
<p class="CC3">1　这位在升天里，凭着那灵，借着门徒，繁殖祂自己的复活基督，乃是神国的实际；神的国就是祂的扩大─一8，八12：</p>
1.　The resurrected Christ, who is propagating Himself in His ascension, by the Spirit, and through the disciples, is the reality of the kingdom of God; the kingdom of God is His expansion—1:8; 8:12:
<p class="CC4">a　众召会就是这位来把自己当作神国种子撒播出去之基督的扩大；这是福音书里所启示的─可四3、26。</p>
a.　The churches are the expansion of Christ, who came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom of God; this is revealed in the Gospels—Mark 4:3, 26.
<p class="CC4">b　在福音书里，基督乃是国度的种子；在使徒行传里有这种子的繁殖，以产生众召会，就是神的国─八1、12，十三1～4。</p>
b.　In the Gospels Christ was the seed of the kingdom; in the book of Acts we have the propagation of this seed to produce the churches as the kingdom of God—8:1, 12; 13:1-4.
<p class="CC3">2　我们在众召会里乃是基督的繁殖，也是基督的扩大，并且我们正在扩展神的国─启一9、11。</p>
2.　We in the churches are the propagation of Christ and the expansion of Christ, and we are enlarging the kingdom of God—Rev. 1:9, 11.
<p class="CC2">四　神的国是基督作生命扩展到祂的信徒里，形成神在祂生命里管治的范围─彼后一3～11：</p>
D.　The kingdom of God is the spreading of Christ as life into His believers to form a realm in which God rules in His life—2 Pet. 1:3-11:
<p class="CC3">1　人要进这国，就需要为罪悔改，相信福音，使他们的罪得赦免，并使他们由神重生，得着符合这国神圣性质之神圣生命─可一15，约三3、5。</p>
1.　To enter into this kingdom, people need to repent of their sins and believe in the gospel so that their sins maybe forgiven and so that they may be regenerated by God to have the divine life, which matches the divine nature of this kingdom—Mark 1:15; John 3:3, 5.
<p class="CC3">2　所有在基督里的信徒，在召会时代都能有分于这国，在神的公义、和平并圣灵中的喜乐里享受神─罗十四17。</p>
2.　All the believers in Christ can share the kingdom in the church age for their enjoyment of God in His righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit—Rom. 14:17.
<p class="CC3">3　神的国在要来的国度时代，要成为基督和神的国，给得胜的信徒承受并享受，好叫他们与基督同王一千年─林前六9～11，加五19～21，弗五5，启二十4、6。</p>
3.　The kingdom of God will become the kingdom of Christ and of God for the overcoming believers to inherit and enjoy in the coming kingdom age so that they may reign with Christ for a thousand years—1 Cor. 6:9-11; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:5; Rev. 20:4, 6.
<p class="CC3">4　神的国是永远的国，要成为神永远生命的永远福分，在新天新地里给神所有的赎民享受，直到永远─二一1～4，二二1～5、14、17。</p>
4.　As the eternal kingdom, the kingdom of God will be an eternal blessing of God's eternal life for all of God's redeemed to enjoy in the new heaven and new earth for eternity—21:1-4; 22:1-5, 14, 17.
<p class="CC2">五　在行传十四章二十二节，保罗劝勉那些恒守信仰的信徒说，我们进入神的国，必须经历许多患难，因为全世界都反对我们进入其中；进入神的国就是进入对基督作为国度的完全享受。─引用经文</p>
E.　In Acts 14:22 Paul entreated the believers who were continuing in the faith to realize that through many tribulations we must enter into the kingdom of God, because the whole world opposes our entering in; to enter into the kingdom of God is to enter into the full enjoyment of Christ as the kingdom.
<p class="CC2">六　在行传十九章我们看见，撒但抵挡神在地上开展祂的国；为着繁殖基督的优胜职事，乃是为着神国的争战─23～41节。</p>
F.　In Acts 19 we see that Satan is fighting against God's spreading of His kingdom on earth; the prevailing ministry for the propagation of Christ is a fighting, a battle, for God's kingdom—vv. 23-41.
<p class="CC2">七　保罗在行传二十八章三十一节宣扬神的国，乃是复活基督的繁殖：─引用经文</p>
G.　Paul's proclaiming the kingdom of God in Acts 28:31 was the propagation of the resurrected Christ:
<p class="CC3">1　这可由“教导主耶稣基督的事”这句话得着证明；主耶稣基督的事乃是与神的国并行的─23节。</p>
1.　This is proved by the words teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, which things go together with the kingdom of God—v. 23.
<p class="CC3">2　教导基督的事，就是普及神的国；所以，神的国实际上就是复活基督的繁殖─这过程今天借由信徒得以继续进行─31节。</p>
2.　To teach concerning Christ is to spread the kingdom of God; therefore, the kingdom of God is actually the propagation of the resurrected Christ—a process that continues to be carried out through the believers today—v. 31.
