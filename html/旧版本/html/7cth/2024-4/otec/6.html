<p class="AA1">第六篇　基督作为神的话</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#808080;">Christ as the Word of God</p>
<p class="AA5">读经：约一1、3～5、14、16～18、29、32、42、51</p>
<p class="CC1">壹　约翰一章是整卷约翰福音的引言，主要强调的乃是基督是神的话─那奥秘且看不见之神的解释、说明和彰显─1节：</p>
I.　John 1 is the introduction to the whole Gospel of John, and the main stress of this introduction is that Christ is the Word of God—the definition, explanation, and expression of the mysterious and invisible God—v. 1:
<p class="CC2">一　基督作为神的话，乃是伟大的“我是”，是自有永有的；祂是永远、无始无终的那一位─出三14～15，约八24、28、58，来七3。</p>
A.　Christ as the Word of God is the great I Am, self-existing and ever-existing; He is the One who is eternal, without beginning or ending—Exo. 3:14-15; John 8:24, 28, 58; Heb. 7:3.
<p class="CC2">二　约翰一章所论到的基督，乃是联于永远的两段与时间的桥梁，并在于宇宙的历史中，创造、成为肉体、救赎、施膏和建造这五件最大的事─参诗九十1～2，弥五2：</p>
B.　John 1 refers to Christ, with the two sections of eternity and the bridge of time, in the five greatest events in the history of the universe—creation, incarnation, redemption, anointing, and building—cf. Psa. 90:1-2; Micah 5:2:
<p class="CC3">1　约翰一章作为整卷约翰福音的引言，乃是“经过旅程的”三一神之历史的摘要，祂在已过的永远里作为话，至终要在将来的永远里成为新耶路撒冷─1、4～5、51节。</p>
1.　John 1, as a prologue to the entire book of John, is an abstract of the history of the "journeying" Triune God as the Word in eternity past, ultimately becoming the New Jerusalem in eternity future—vv. 1, 4-5, 51.
<p class="CC3">2　约翰一章以结晶的方式给我们看见，永远的话在祂创造的工作中，又行经时间的桥梁，成为肉体，以完成祂法理的救赎；为要成为施膏、赐生命并使人变化的灵，以施行祂生机的拯救；至终与祂所重生、变化、荣化的新妇完满的联结、调和且合并，而成为新耶路撒冷，终极的伯特利，就是神与人相互的住处。</p>
2.　John 1 shows us in a crystallized way the eternal Word in His creating work and in His journeying across the bridge of time to become flesh for the accomplishing of His judicial redemption; to become the anointing, life-giving, and transforming Spirit for carrying out His organic salvation; and ultimately to become fully united, mingled, and incorporated with His regenerated, transformed, and glorified bride to be the New Jerusalem, the ultimate Bethel, the mutual abode of God and man.
<p class="CC2">三　在这五件宇宙的历史事件上，神的话基督─作为：㈠在创造时的创造者；㈡在成为肉体时的人，支搭帐幕在我们中间；㈢在救赎时的羔羊；㈣在变化时施膏的那灵；㈤在为着神的建造把地联于天时的梯子─解释、说明并彰显那看不见的神─参1节，十35，弗六17，约六63。</p>
C.　In these five universal, historical events, Christ, the Word of God—as: (1) the Creator in creation, (2) the man who tabernacled among us in incarnation, (3) the Lamb in redemption, (4) the anointing Spirit in transformation, and (5) the ladder in joining earth to heaven for God's building—defines, explains, and expresses the invisible God—cf. v. 1; 10:35; Eph. 6:17; John 6:63.
<p class="CC1">贰　基督作为神的话，借着创造为神说话─一3：</p>
II.　Christ as the Word of God speaks for God through His creation—1:3:
<p class="CC2">一　“诸天述说神的荣耀，穹苍传扬祂手的作为。这日到那日发出言语；这夜到那夜传出知识。无言无语，也无声音可听”─诗十九1～3。</p>
A.　"The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His hands. / Day to day pours forth speech, / And night to night tells out knowledge. / There is no speech and there are no words; / Their voice is not heard"—Psa. 19:1-3.
<p class="CC2">二　“自从创造世界以来，神那看不见永远的大能，和神性的特征，是人所洞见的，乃是借着受造之物，给人晓得的，叫人无法推诿”─罗一20。</p>
B.　"The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse"—Rom. 1:20.
<p class="CC2">三　行传十四章十五至十七节，和十七章二十四至二十九节所说的，都同样启示基督的创造为神说话─参来十一3，一2，西一15～17，该二7。</p>
C.　What is referred to in Acts 14:15-17 and 17:24-29 serves the same purpose of revealing Christ's creation speaking for God—cf. Heb. 11:3; 1:2; Col. 1:15-17; Hag. 2:7.
<p class="CC1">叁　基督作为神的话，成为肉体作神的帐幕，借此为神说话─约一14：</p>
III.　Christ as the Word of God speaks for God through His incarnation as the tabernacle of God—John 1:14:
<p class="CC2">一　话借着成为肉体，不仅把神带到人性里，也成为神的帐幕，作神在地上人间的居所，丰丰满满地有恩典，有实际：</p>
A.　The Word, by being incarnated, not only brought God into humanity but also became a tabernacle to God as God's habitation on earth among men, being full of grace and reality:
<p class="CC3">1　律法是照着神的所是要求人，恩典却是以神的所是供应人，以应付神的要求─17节。</p>
1.　The law makes demands on man according to what God is; grace supplies man with what God is to meet what God demands—v. 17.
<p class="CC3">2　“从祂的丰满里我们都领受了，而且恩上加恩”─16节。</p>
2.　"Of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace"— v. 16.
<p class="CC2">二　在祂成为肉体时，祂成为三一神的具体化身，将神带给人，并使神成为可接触、可摸着、可接受、可经历、可进入并可享受的。</p>
B.　In His becoming flesh, He became the embodiment of the Triune God, bringing God to man and making God contactable, touchable, receivable, experienceable, enterable, and enjoyable.
<p class="CC2">三　祂成了神人，将神性带到人性里，并使神性与人性调和。</p>
C.　He became a God-man, bringing divinity into humanity and mingling divinity with humanity.
<p class="CC2">四　神的独生子成为肉体，也是为着在话、生命、光、恩典和实际中，向人表明（说明）神─18节：</p>
D.　The incarnation of God's only begotten Son is also for declaring (explaining) God to man in the Word, in life, in light, in grace, and in reality—v. 18:
<p class="CC3">1　话是神的彰显、说明和解释，叫人得以明白神。</p>
1.　The Word is God expressed, explained, and defined so that man may understand God.
<p class="CC3">2　生命是神的分赐，叫人得以接受神。</p>
2.　Life is God imparted so that man may receive God.
<p class="CC3">3　光是神的照耀，叫人得以蒙光照而有分于神。</p>
3.　Light is God shining so that man may be enlightened to partake of God.
<p class="CC3">4　恩典是神给人享受，叫人得以分享神的丰富。</p>
4.　Grace is God enjoyed by man so that man may share His riches.
<p class="CC3">5　实际是神给人实化，叫人得以领略并认识神。</p>
5.　Reality is God realized by man so that man may apprehend and know God.
<p class="CC1">肆　基督作为神的话，成为神的羔羊完成救赎，借此为神说话─29、36节：</p>
IV.　Christ as the Word of God speaks for God through His becoming the Lamb of God for redemption—vv. 29, 36:
<p class="CC2">一　在祂成为羔羊，以救赎失落之世人的事上，基督向我们说出，神如何按祂的公义，借祂的死作为手续，在法理方面完成了祂的救赎。</p>
A.　In His becoming the Lamb for the redemption of the lost world, Christ speaks to us how God accomplished His redemption judicially through His death as the procedure according to His righteousness.
<p class="CC2">二　神的羔羊表征在肉体里的话，作一切旧约祭物的应验，成就神完全的救赎─来十5～10：</p>
B.　The Lamb of God signifies the Word in the flesh as the fulfillment of all the Old Testament offerings to accomplish God's full redemption—Heb. 10:5-10:
<p class="CC3">1　基督是赎罪祭、赎愆祭、燔祭、素祭、平安祭、摇祭、举祭和奠祭的实际。</p>
1.　Christ is the reality of the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the wave offering, the heave offering, and the drink offering.
<p class="CC3">2　我们有基督作一切的供物，就有神完满的救赎，也能经历并享受这救赎。</p>
2.　With Christ as all the offerings, we have God's full redemption, and we may experience and enjoy this redemption.
<p class="CC1">伍　基督作为神的话，成为施膏的灵，为着新约在生机上使蒙神救赎的人变化成为石头（约一32～42），以建造神的家（伯特利─51），借此为神说话：─引用经文</p>
V.　Christ as the Word of God speaks for God through His becoming the anointing Spirit for the transformation of God's redeemed people into stones (John 1:32-42) for the building of God's house (Bethel—v. 51) organically for the New Testament:
<p class="CC2">一　在祂成为施膏、赐生命并使人变化之灵的事上（林前十五45），基督对我们进一步说出，神如何照祂的心愿，为着祂神圣的定旨，凭祂的神圣生命，在生机方面完成祂的经纶。─引用经文</p>
A.　In His becoming the anointing, life-giving, and transforming Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45), Christ speaks to us further how God carries out His economy organically by His divine life for His divine purpose according to His heart's desire.
<p class="CC2">二　我们需要儆醒，不让我们日常生活中的任何一件事，顶替我们灵里的基督这施膏的灵─约壹二20、27：</p>
B.　We need to be watchful to not allow anything in our daily living to replace Christ as the anointing Spirit in our spirit—1 John 2:20, 27:
<p class="CC3">1　基督是受膏者成了施膏者，也成了膏油涂抹；活在敌基督者的原则里，就是敌挡膏油涂抹（“敌挡”意“反对”，和“取代”、“代替”）─18、22节，四3，约贰7。</p>
1.　Christ is the anointed One becoming the anointing One and also the anointing; to live in the principle of antichrist is to be anti the anointing (anti means "against" and "in place of, instead of")—vv. 18, 22; 4:3; 2 John 7.
<p class="CC3">2　敌基督的就是反对基督，也是以别的事物顶替基督。</p>
2.　To be anti Christ is both to be against Christ and to replace Christ with something else.
<p class="CC3">3　如果我们以出于自己行为和性格的东西顶替基督，就着让某些事物顶替基督自己的意义说，我们乃是实行敌基督者的原则─参腓一21，四4～9。</p>
3.　If we replace Christ with something of our own behavior and character, we are practicing the principle of antichrist in the sense of allowing certain things to replace Christ Himself— cf. Phil. 1:21; 4:4-9.
<p class="CC3">4　我们需要悔改，因为我们在敌基督者的原则里过日常的生活，让文化、宗教、伦理和天然观念顶替基督这内里的膏油涂抹；这乃是反对膏油涂抹，敌挡三一神在我们里面的运行、工作和浸透。</p>
4.　We need to repent for having a daily living in the principle of antichrist, allowing culture, religion, ethics, and natural concepts to replace Christ as the inner anointing; this is to be against the anointing, anti the moving, working, and saturating of the Triune God within us.
<p class="CC3">5　我们该祷告：“主，我们要在膏油涂抹（我们里面三一神的运行、工作和浸透）里面，同着、借着并凭着膏油涂抹而生活行动。”</p>
5.　We should pray, "Lord, we want to live and walk in, with, through, and by the anointing—the moving, working, and saturating of the Triune God within us."
<p class="CC2">三　鸽子，就是施膏的灵，使受造的人重生，膏抹且变化天然的人，使其成为活石，并将变化过的人联结一起。</p>
C.　The dove, the anointing Spirit, regenerates the created man, anoints and transforms the natural man into living stones, and unites the transformed man.
<p class="CC2">四　在彼得悔改信主时，主给他取了一个新名，就是彼得─石头（约一42）；当他得着关于基督的启示之后，主进一步启示祂也是磐石─石头（太十六16～18）；这两件事给彼得深刻的印象，就是基督和祂的信徒都是为着神的建造的石头（彼前二4～8）。─引用经文</p>
D.　At Peter's conversion the Lord gave him a new name, Peter— a stone (John 1:42), and when Peter received the revelation concerning Christ, the Lord revealed further that He was the rock—a stone (Matt. 16:16-18); by these two incidents Peter received the impression that both Christ and His believers are stones for God's building (1 Pet. 2:4-8).
<p class="CC1">陆　基督作为神的话，为着神的建造成为梯子，将天（神）带到地（人），并将地（人）与天（神）联合为一，借此为神说话─约一51，创二八11～22：</p>
VI.　Christ as the Word of God speaks for God through His becoming the ladder that brings heaven (God) to earth (man) and joins earth (man) to heaven (God) as one for God's building— John 1:51; Gen. 28:11-22:
<p class="CC2">一　在祂成为伯特利的天梯这事上，基督也对我们说出，神如何渴望在地上得着一个由祂所救赎并变化之选民所构成的家，使祂可以把天带到地，并把地联于天，使二者成为一，直到永远。</p>
A.　Christ, in His being the heavenly ladder at Bethel, also speaks to us how God desires to have a house on the earth, constituted with His redeemed and transformed elect, so that He may bring heaven to earth and join earth to heaven, to make the two as one for eternity.
<p class="CC2">二　雅各的梦乃是启示基督，因为基督是雅各在伯特利（神的家）所见之梯子的实际─12节，约一51：</p>
B.　Jacob's dream is a revelation of Christ, for Christ is the reality of the ladder that Jacob saw at Bethel, the house of God—v. 12; John 1:51:
<p class="CC3">1　我们重生的灵作为神今日的居所（弗二22），是基督这天梯立在地上的基础（提后四22）。─引用经文</p>
1.　Our regenerated spirit, which is God's dwelling place today (Eph. 2:22), is the base on earth where Christ as the heavenly ladder has been set up (2 Tim. 4:22).
<p class="CC3">2　伯特利是神的家，神的居所，也是天的门；在那里基督是梯子，把地联于天，并把天带到地；因此，每当我们转到灵里，就经历基督作梯子，将神带给我们，也将我们带给神。</p>
2.　At Bethel, the house of God, the habitation of God, which is the gate of heaven, Christ is the ladder that joins earth to heaven and brings heaven to earth; hence, whenever we turn to our spirit, we experience Christ as the ladder bringing God to us and us to God.
<p class="CC3">3　基督作天梯的结果是神的建造─伯特利，就是召会，基督的身体；这梯子的终极完成乃是新耶路撒冷。</p>
3.　The issue of Christ as the heavenly ladder is God's building— Bethel, the church, the Body of Christ—and the consummation of this ladder is the New Jerusalem.
<p class="CC2">三　“主的回来，需要寻求祂的人有扎实的建造。这建造乃是踏脚石，滩头堡，让祂能取得地；这建造乃是神人相互的住处。它将是神性和人性，人性和神性的调和，直到永远。……这建造不仅是雅各的梦终极的实现，也是神永远计划的完成。这会结束时间的桥梁，引进将来有福的永远。我们必须是为着那建造，并且我们必须就是那建造。”（约翰福音smdj，七三至七四页）</p>
C.　"The Lord's coming back needs a solid building of His seekers. This building will be a steppingstone, a beachhead, for Him to take the earth, and it will be a mutual abode for both God and man. It will be the mingling of divinity with humanity and of humanity with divinity forever…This building will be the ultimate fulfillment not only of Jacob's dream but also of God's eternal plan. It will terminate the bridge of time and usher in the blessed eternity in the future. We must be for that building, and we must be that building!" (Life-study of John, 2nd ed., p. 65).
