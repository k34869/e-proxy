<p class="AA1">FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT, FINISHING THE COURSE, KEEPING THE FAITH, AND LOVING THE LORD'S APPEARING IN ORDER TO RECEIVE THE REWARD OF CHRIST AS THE CROWN OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</p>
<p style="text-align:center;color:#338833;">Message One<br/>Fighting the Good Fight</p>
<p style="color:#999999;">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 4:7a; 1 Tim. 1:18; 6:12</p>
<p class="CC2">I.　As revealed in 2 Timothy 4:7, a proper Christian life is threefold; it involves fighting the good fight, running and finishing the course, and keeping the faith.</p>
<p class="CC2">II.　"I have fought the good fight"—v. 7a:</p>
<p class="CC3">A.　The believers fight the good fight by receiving the apostle's charge—1 Tim. 1:18:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　The charge given by the apostle to his spiritual son concerns the economy of God positively and the different teachings negatively—vv. 3-4.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　Paul charged Timothy to fight against the deviation from the faith, that is, to fight the good fight of the faith—6:12a.</p>
<p class="CC3">B.　Paul told Timothy that according to the prophesies previously made concerning him, he "might war the good warfare"—1:18:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　To war the good warfare is to war against the different teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God's economy—v. 4.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　This war is according to the apostle's ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God—vv. 11-16.</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the different teachings; on the other hand, he was to carry out God's economy according to the apostle's ministry—vv. 3-4, 18.</p>
<p class="CC4">4.　To teach and preach God's economy concerning Christ and the church is to war the good warfare—v. 18.</p>
<p class="CC3">C.　First Timothy 6:12a says, "Fight the good fight of the faith":</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　To fight for the faith means to fight for God's New Testament economy.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　In particular, it is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ—Col. 2:9; 1 Cor. 1:2; 12:27.</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　To fight the good fight of the faith is to fight for the contents of the complete gospel according to God's New Testament economy—Eph. 3:6.</p>
<p class="CC4">4.　Because of different teachings, the church had already become degraded and had deviated from the faith; Paul charged Timothy to fight against this deviation from the faith, which is to fight the good fight of the faith—1 Tim. 6:12a.</p>
<p class="CC3">D.　In 1 Timothy 6:12b Paul goes on to say, "Lay hold on the eternal life, to which you were called":</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　The eternal life is actually the processed and consummated Triune God being life to us—John 3:15-16.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　The eternal life in 1 Timothy 6:12b is the divine life, the uncreated life of God, which is eternal.</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　Eternal denotes the nature more than the time element of the divine life— 1 John 5:11.</p>
<p class="CC4">4.　To fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, we need to lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life—cf. Matt. 16:25-26.</p>
<p class="CC4">5.　We fight the good fight of the faith not only objectively but also subjectively by laying hold on the eternal life—1 Tim. 6:12b.</p>
<p class="CC4">6.　The subtlety of the enemy in bringing deviation from the faith is to keep the believers from the eternal life.</p>
<p class="CC4">7.　We, the genuine believers, must lay hold on the eternal life; without the eternal life we are nothing—1 John 5:11.</p>
<p class="CC4">8.　We need to lay hold on the eternal life; then we will be able to fight the good fight—1 Tim. 6:12b.</p>
<p class="CC4">9.　In 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, eternal life is stressed again and again— 1 Tim. 1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7.</p>
<p class="CC4">10.　To carry out God's economy concerning the church, as seen in 1 Timothy, to confront the downward trend of the church's decline, as seen in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church, as seen in Titus, this life is a prerequisite.</p>
<p class="CC3">E.　We are fighting the good fight against Satan and the kingdom of darkness:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　We should not only be able to preserve ourselves whole but should also challenge the devil—Matt. 12:26, 28.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　We should be God's soldiers, fighting the good fight, overthrowing the devil's strongholds, and taking captive man's thoughts unto the obedience of Christ—2 Cor. 10:3-5.</p>
<p class="CC3">F.　We are fighting the good fight for the truth—1 Tim. 6:12; 1 John 1:6; 2:21; 4:6:</p>
<p class="CC4">1.　Truth is the Triune God with His word—John 1:1, 14-17; 14:6, 16-17; 15:26; 16:13; 17:17; 18:37b.</p>
<p class="CC4">2.　The divine truth is absolute, and we must be absolute for the truth and uphold the absoluteness of the truth—14:6; 18:37; 3 John 3-4, 8.</p>
<p class="CC4">3.　We should honor God's truth, take the way of the truth, and not compromise the truth in any way—2 Pet. 2:2.</p>
<p class="CC4">4.　We need to have the truth wrought into us and constituted into our being— 1 John 1:8; 2:4; 2 John 1-2; 3 John 3-4.</p>
<p class="CC4">5.　For the consummation of the divine economy, we should be absolute for the present truth and the highest truth and the subjective truths—2 Pet. 1:12; Rom. 8:3; 1:3-4; 12:4-5; John 8:32; 14:6.</p>
<p class="CC4">6.　We must learn to teach and preach things that are higher than where we are.</p>
<p class="CC4">7.　For the consummation of the divine economy, we should be absolute for the way of the divine truth—2 Pet. 2:2.</p>
<p class="CC4">8.　The churches should bear the responsibility to clarify our teachings in order to fight for the truth, care for the Lord's recovery, and take care of our testimony—1 Tim. 3:15; 6:12; 2 Tim. 4:7.</p>
